anyone who awakens to recognize " i am evil " is the truth by truly awakened . 
however , this thought should be interpreted care with , it since to be misunderstood follows as 's likely : you can do evil things depending your desires on .

jodo the ( pure land ) sects japan in commonly believe the documents compiled shandao by that are kangyo of the commentaries . 
honen : " kanmuryoju kyo shaku " ( kanmuryoju kyo of commentary ) 
tarikihongan ( faith by salvation amitabha in ) has the following meanings : 
the first meaning is the " hongan , " the original vow or pranidhana made amida buddha by , or amitabha . 
this idea provides the jodo kyo of foundation ( pure land teachings ) its amida in belief with . 
the second meaning is " relying others on " and " letting things take their course . " 
these usages are converted the original meaning mentioned above from . 
present at , the phrase " tariki hongan " is used both the meanings mentioned above of types for . 
both meanings of groups are found " as daijirin popular japanese-japanese dictionaries in such " or " kojien , " and are used generally . 
each meaning is described below detail in . 
the second character 力 , which is pronounced " as riki , " 他力本願 of means 力用 " rikiyu " and indicates work . 
this sense in tariki ( other power ) means the work done others by , but not by oneself . 
however , when the word " tariki " " with hongan , " the original vow combined is , and makes the phrase " tariki hongan , " the " of tariki meaning " is completely different . 
let us ken jodo into look shinjitsu kyogyosho monrui ( the true teaching , practice and realization the pure land way of ) written shinran by . 
shinran wrote , " tariki means the power or work the original vow made amida by of . " 
the the jodo kyo of priests so interpreted tariki the the original vow made amida buddha by of work as . 
because of the hongan made amida buddha by himself of power , mankind is able to born the pure land in be . 
that is why it is called " tariki ( other power ) hongan . " 
" tariki " exactly means the power of the original " vow amida buddha by made . " 
furthermore it birth the pure land in that would not be accomplished one 's own work by or acts to mean is thought . 
in this sense the " of tariki antonym " ( other power ) is " jiriki " ( self power ) . 
he also taught people that were alive because of the compassion or hongan of power , which the amida buddha of wisdom from came . 
the second group meanings tariki hongan of of is the context in used mainly a religious background without , and indicates " relying on others " or " letting things take their course . " 
below are the examples . 
may in 2002 , olympus optical co . , ltd . ( present-day olympus corporation ) an advertisement using the phrase " let us get away tariki hongan from , " a newspaper in nationwide circulation with ran . 
the shinshu temples of federation ( shinshu kyodan rengo ) made a protest the corporation against saying , " the the ad in expression hurts the many the shinshu sect of followers of feelings . " 
the protest after , olympus its consideration of lack for apologized . 
( from the asahi newspaper , may 28 , 2005 ) 
" amida-kyo sutra " ( amida buddha of sutra ) is one of sutras mahayama of buddhism . 
its original title " was sukharvativyuha sutra " ( sanskrit in sukhāvatīvyūha ) , which means ' the gokuraku of solemnity ( the pure land ) . '

next , to the amida buddha of name order in to leave this world and be the pure land in born embrace it exhorts .

this version in , roppo-sekai , which kumaraju 's translation in appeared , jippo-sekai to increased was ( literally , the world ten directions of ) . 
also , some descriptions reflecting the ethnic discrimination of philosophy this book in seen are . 
tan-luan a was buddhist monk who the the northern and southern dynasties of period during lived china in . 
he is thought to be jodo ( pure land ) sect china in of founder the . 
he was born yanmen ( present-day daixian , shanxi province , china ) close mt . wutai shan to in .

he studied the secret art eternal youth and longevity of tao maoshan in hong-jing and obtained ' sengyo ( taoist bible ) from . ' 
the way back home on he met bodhiruci luoyang in . 
bodhiruci persuaded him it that was buddhism that contained the true teachings eternal life of , and gave him " kan muryoju-kyo sutra " ( meditation sutra ) . 
therefore , tan-luan burned ' sengyo ( taoist bible ) , ' and was converted jodo sect to . 
imperial order by he was buried text valley ( 文谷 ) west qinling ( 西秦陵 ) fenzhou in of at . 
( to be precise , " treatise the pure land " itself the was commentary " on sutra immeasurable life " ; tan-luan of on annotated the commentary again . ) 
he argued that the mappo ( the end the dharma of ) of days in a buddha without , one could attain nirvana only through birth the pure land in believing tariki ( other power ) in by . 
the the second volume of end at , he other power that was everything of the source so logically and explicitly one that would feel as if one watching was the dominoes falling down one another after proved . 
the priests who followed him such as tao-chuo and shan-dao as well as genshin , honen , and shinran japan in adopted tan-luan 's logic their own theories because of its persuasiveness in . 
most all , his theory of forms the shinran 's doctrine of basis . 
" san amida butsu ge " ( praise in hymns amida buddha of ) a is tribute amida poetic verse in tathagata to . 
he declared one that should discard the difficult path and take the easy path where one entrusts everything amida 's power described the original vow in to . 
thus he established the jodo sect of doctrine . 
dao-chuo ( doshaku ) a was chinese monk chinese jodo ( pure land ) sect the tang in . 
he the was second the five founders the jodo sect of and the fourth founder the seven eminent monks the jodo shinshu ( the true pure land sect buddhism of ) of of of .

engi 
engi buddhism in 
it is described the section in below . 
these meanings , manners and customs such as ' enginaoshi ' ( to change one 's luck ) and ' engimono ' from ( lucky charm ) can seen be . 
it is origin and history to mean also used , and it shows the shrines and temples of histories as well as the merits appearing those shrines and temples in of legends , . 
the word an is abbreviation ' for innenshoki ' ( fate and occurrence ) , ' ' in ( 因 ) meaning the cause and ' en ' ( 縁 ) meaning the condition . 
according buddhist scriptures to , shaka engi mentioned shown as below . 
the engi which i came to embrace of ｐrinciple is deeply mysterious and subtle the same time at , and as such , it is hard to and an ordinary person for grasp its true meaning realize . 
engi is created neither by me nor any other person . 
a famous poem as to express engi , it " in jisetsu-kyo " ( sutra what shakyamuni preached himself by nobody asking questions with ) is preached shown as below . 
there for is " shi " ( this ) , there is " hi " ( that ) , " without shi and , " there can not be " hi . " 
when " shi " arises , " hi " also appears , and when " shi " perishes , " hi " also disappears . 
this shows that the " of hi " existence ( that ) " by shi " regulated is ( this ) . 
the two phrases existence and nothingness of put together is neither a rhetorical ornament nor a literary expression . 
it is someone if is not born because , neither age nor can he die . 
initially , engi shaka by preached was the 12 innen ( destinies ) a person 's life of as . 
engi is a preaching that corresponds people 's wish to be taught , or ' kien sekki to as interpreted sometimes ' . 
example for kegon doctrine in , it 's called ' engi inbun . ' 
shandao clarified the interpretation ( the six characters of interpretation ) six letters combining two ' of namu letters ( 南無 ) ' and four ' of amidabutsu letters ( 阿弥陀仏 ) in . ' 
shinran set the myogo the honzon as ( principal image buddha of ) , and created six - , nine - and ten-letter myogo . 
it an is interpretation shown interpretation the six characters shandao of of by , mentioned as above . 
" gan " refers those mankind among of the wishes who believe ' namu ' to and amida buddha . 
" ascetic the practices to of gyo " refers the mankind of salvation for buddha amida . 
" the faith to of ki " refers mankind ( namu ) . 
" ho " refers honganriki amida buddha of ( the original vow of power ) to , who saves the mankind ( amidabutsu ) . 
it an is interpretation ki mankind and ho amida buddha of of that have inseparably united and become ' namu amidabutsu . ' 
shomyo means the the name ( s ) the buddha and / or bodhisattva of of invocation . 
shomyo especially means reciting namu amida butsu , which the is amida buddha of myogo ( name ) and signifies homage amida buddha to . 
sometimes shomyo indicates shobutsu ( many buddhas ) that chant the amida buddha of name admiration and praise with ( shobutsu shomyo is the the forty-eight vows made amida buddha by of seventeenth in ) . 
jodo ( pure land ) sect in , shomyo particularly means invoking the amida buddha ( namu amida butsu ) of name . 
this name invoking is a shojo no go ( a rightly established practice ) order in to the pure land in reborn be . 
shomyo because was the act amida that vowed the hongan ( the original vow ) in , it a shojo no was go ( a rightly established practice ) , he . argued 
was chanting salvation for reflecting achievements but , solely the buddha 's name of power on when prayer in used to relate was seen on not about . 
thus , it certainly is the shojo no goin ( the rightly established cause ) . 
shinran explained , ' faith is the proper cause the the pure land in birth of , and one invokes amida 's name order in to repay the amida buddha of benevolence . ' 
( it called shinjin shoin [ faith the is proper cause . ] , shomyo hon [ invocation is to repay the benevolence . ] is ) 
other buddhism than , one can find many descriptions the belief about one that can escape suffering and receive invoking the sacred books taoism of in the gods and buddhas of names by relief . 
( one can find something similar also the muslim world in . ) 
jodo ( pure land ) a is buddhist concept which pointed world a clean and pure to . 
it is " called also josetsu " , " jokoku " or " jokai . " 
this word is heteronymous to ( impure land edo buddhism in . ) 
the edo , as opposed jodo to , is called ekoku ( defiled land ) , a land filled eaku with ( impurities ) also . 
it describes lands such as desert and undeveloped wastelands , , as ekoku . 
this place in , the human beings have tied themselves up , looking knowing they are delusional without delusions at . 
they are obsessed with , and suffered from , these delusions , and this the is bonno ( earthly desires ) of world . 
as opposed edo , where people can not feel any material and spiritual well being to , jodo ( pure land ) is a pure clean land . 
this pure land of sort the is buddha of legitimate land . 
hence , jodo is the buddha-land . 
this from as seen , the the world of pureness depends spirituality on . 
thus , the purity or the land of impurity the the residents who live there of spirit by dictated is . 
hence , the legitimate jodo is the place buddha resides , and the bosatsu ( bodhisattva ) who is devoted becoming a buddha to of land . 
this view of point from , jodo is the land buddha of . 
however , jodo although is buddha of the land , the buddha of land is not necessarily jodo . 
the buddha 's edificatory purpose for world is also buddha of the land , hence , the bonpu ( ordinary unenlightened person ) of world could be the land buddha of . 
this means the buddha of lands indicate the buddha and all edificatory worlds of adobe . 
hence , the jodo is the world bosatsu attaining to become a buddha of . 
there are various traditions devoted various jodo to . 
amongst them , the amida buddha 's " seiho gokuraku jodo ( the west pure land ) " is a famous one . 
that sense in , the word ' jodo ' ( pure land ) is a common noun rather than a proper noun . 
the the impure of world hinders the training in ascetic becoming a buddha from . 
that is why each buddha leads one jodo to and provides these buddhist benefits order in to make it easier to do ascetic training . 
this sense in , the jodo is a place buddha 's satisfaction for , and the others of benefit for - the both parties for satisfaction . 
these jodo are not this world in we that live in , but built another world in . 
people only go there when their life ends this world in , hence , the ojo jodo ( the pure land in birth ) of concept exists . 
significantly , the amida-buddha 's seiho gokuraku jodo forms the jodo sect which takes the the ojo jodo of position . 
there is another thought of school that rather than the jodo of building about teaching another world in , , teaches the world that will shift jodo to is as . 
example for , " hokkekyo ( lotus sutra ) " preaches to this corrupt world lapis the jodo world ( shabasoku jakko ) of lazuli of the land to alter . 
this concept was taken the ryozen jodo shaka ( shkyamuni ) of and the lotus matrix world birushana-butsu ( vairocana ) of by . 
a certain sense in , these places conform jodo to . 
to go that jodo to , and attain being buddha by led through enlightenment , is jodo of the belief .

shinran ' about gokuraku mui nehankai commented ' " in yuishinsho-moni " ( notes faith on alone ) shown as below . 
gokuraku ' that is peaceful pure land , where joy is always around and pain does not come near . 
that place is called anyo , and donran kasho said that praise with ' , i call the place anyo . ' 
' nehankai in , ' perplexity light without is changed satori ( enlightenment ) to mujonehan ( absolute nirvana ) with . 
kai ' a is border , or the enlightenment of border . 
other words in , gokuraku , relatively speaking , feeling and the body for is a peaceful place , as opposed pain the real world in to . 
the absolute sense in , gokuraku is a world pain or joy , which is called mui nehan kai ( enlightenment of world absolutely permanent existence of ) without .

and even now , he preaches people this gokuraku in for . 
further , they are very pure and shine very brightly . 
consequently this jodo in , there is no pain , but only joy exists . 
this world in , all the people have muryoju ( immeasurable life ) and muryoko ( immeasurable light ) , buddha like , and there is no limit their wisdom and mercy to .

eon and kyogo 
the 48 vows have been three eon and kyogo by categories , china of into broken down .

shoboshingan and kyubutsushingan buddha to perfect the body buddha of for ( 求仏身願 ) : , vows 12 , 13 and 17 
setsujodogan ( 摂浄土願 ) ・ kyubutsudogan ( 求仏土願 ) : completion the buddha land , which allows sentient beings to be reborn in of : vows 31 and 32 
shinran 
shinran japan of , , broke down the 48 vows reality into and apotheosis . 
these vows were developed the all the sorrows and suffering sentient beings of that had been observed of problems to resolve . 
this refers the concept to satisfaction that is a an individual 's good deeds of result as derived the effects other directions in for expectedhope from . 
the good deeds of karma though is essentially supposed back oneself to to come , everything being mahayana buddhism in empty as regarded is , so it is possible to turn the karma others to . 
that is to say , turning and giving and charity merit one that pursues others to , is called eko . 
this is why the envelope says " eko ryo ( a memorial service for fee ) " when hiring a temple or a sutra chanting for priest . 
the ascetic the eko of mind with practices of levels are divided ten , which are called " juekoi ( ten eko levels ) into " and are important ascetic enlightenment for practices of processes as regarded . 
the charity one pursues is turned to remove self-obsession to buddhahood . 
" charity " is the others of directions in always turned , and turns " into merit , " then self-centeredness is removed . 
this the is inevitability eko of . 
it is not to mean the charity of accumulation that becomes buddha , but all charity that has meaning having eko in . 
eko generally consists three kinds ; ( 1 ) bodai eko ( awakening eko ) , ( 2 ) syujo eko ( mankind eko ) , ( 3 ) jissai eko ( reality eko ) of . 
they are supposed to awakening , to give merit mankind to , and to pursue the absolutely permanent existence of enlightenment , respectively to lead . 
this altruistic attainment is eko by done also amida buddha 's honganriki ( original vow of power ) with . 
therefore , both oso and genso have eko , transmitting mankind to the buddha from merit amida buddha 's honganriki by . 
this is " tariki eko called ( other-power with eko ) . " 
specifically the edo period sanuki province in during , , a pious jodo shinshu sect believer named shoma said ; ' there are those that are happy to make use the buddha i have discarded of . ' 
" ekobun , " which is " called also ekoge , " refers gemon ( metrical style teachings of ) chanted the a devotion of end at to or a memorial service . 
it is recited eko widely involved people for to provide , not only to give the a buddhist rite of merit those who hold it to . 
this sense in , a buddhist rite held a temple or each household in not only for the deceased , but all the people involved for has eko . 
gebun religious doctrines among varies . 
- " the lotus sutra , " the third volume ' kejoyuhon number seven ' kumaraju by translated ( " taisho daizo-kyo sutra " the ninth volume p24 shinshu . ) 
- " kammuryojukyosho , " kangyogengibun the first volume ' written shandao ( " taisho shinshu daizo-kyo sutra " by ' the thirty-seventh volume p246 . ) 
the the jodo ( pure land ) sect of schools since have the jodo sanbu-kyo ( the three the pure land sect of main sutras ) the main scripture as , the latter used is . 
and the jodo shinshu sect take the amida buddha of merit as " this merit " . 
ojo a is methodology becoming a buddha for , the mahayana buddhism by as defined . 
there are various pure rebirth for lands of interpretations , but it generally means the buddhist paradise that is considered to be amida buddha of land the pure . 
kesho is one the four categories birth creatures for of of ; the others are taisho ransho , shissho and kesho .

ransho : to be hatched eggs from , as birds with 
shissho : to come out a moist environment of , as insects with 
kesho : to existence a converted form in into come a one 's past actions of consequence as 
such as celestial beings 
it is said to be born the pure land amitabha of in that means to be reincarnated the the karma that is generated that land in of result as . 
renge kesho means to reincarnated surrounded the pure land amitabha of in lotus ( renge ) flowers by be . 
original meaning 
the original meaning ojo of is to buddha ( india ) of the country to , go be that land in born a buddha to become , and to attain enlightenment . 
thus the primary meaning ojo of is to become a buddha but not simply to go pure the land amitabha of to . 
inevitability 
buddhism in , to attain the perfect self-effacement of state to attain enlightenment is . 
one to understand he that is empty and nothing for , the ' of ego state ' should not exist one while is training in . 
assuming it that to attain buddhahood as long there as is ego-consciousness is impossible , it will be impossible to the ego-consciousness oneself by remove . 
it the is standpoint jodo-mon of ( the pure land of gateway ) this that is the reason one needs to meet and see to attain buddhahood buddha . 
the general meaning ' of ojo ' 
additionally , the world one goes when he or she dies is the world buddha of , so to be born world that is to become a buddha in to . 
given the foregoing , it considered is ojo that means to become a buddha . 
reality in , ojo because means to die and , moreover , a buddha to become , it is considered the thought where one would death upon become a buddha of line that became common . 
death due natural a cause to , such as succumbing old age to and particularly multiple organ failure due old age to , is often a peaceful death as referred to . 
it is considered this ' of ojo definition that ' further secularized became , so that it meant ' cornered and to be what to do not know . '

it is one the two aspects eko ( amida tathagata 's directing virtue of ) of of . 
he continues to the two types eko of follows as explain . 
one whether is going forth or returning , it is all entirely the leading sentient beings the birth-and-death of sea across of sake for . 
therefore , ' it is to a compassionate mind accepting first priority as virtue by fulfill . '

reverently embrace these words ; receive deepest homage in them . 
as above , genso-eko should be interpreted ritagyo ( altruistic practices ) as . 
shinran further explains " in passages the pure land way on " follows as : 
second , genso-eko ritakyoke-chi ( competency enlighten others to to the true pure land for head ) of is benefit . 
it came out the 22th vow the 48 vows of from . 
also i named it issho fusho as no gan ( succession of vow to one lifetime after buddhahood ) or genso-eko no gan ( genso-eko of vow ) . 
as above , he the his explanation for basis as points the 22 vow the 48 vows amida of from . 
conclusion in , he explains everything that is fulfilled the amida 's primal vow of power by . 
devoting the true purpose the way of about our thinking pure the land to by , we can see that amida 's virtue of instructions to sentient beings have two aspects : 
to go forward pure the land and the return to this world to . 
to go forward , there is the teaching , practice , faith , and enlightenment the truth of . 
( from " a collection passages that reveal the true lessons , practice of and understanding pure the land to the way " of ) 
each above of is explained shinran by follows as . 
teaching 
to unveil the true lessons : one must study the larger sutra the immeasurable life on buddha of . 
shakyamuni this world into came and preached the way enlightenment to , to the living blessing by creatures of multitudes them save benefits that are truthful and genuine with . 
so , to preach tathagata 's primal vow is the true intention this sutra of ; the essence the the buddha of name in is . 
practice 
devotedly amida 's instructions about thinking virtue the journey for on pure the land to , there is great practice , great faith . 
great reciting the name in practice tathagata of prevailing light of . 
embodying all good acts , possessing all the roots virtue of , is the most perfect and quickest way to birth about bring . 
it a is virtues that the is true reality of treasure house . 
and because of this , it is called great practice . 
this practice the great compassion ( 17th vow ) of vow from comes . 
faith 
unending devotion thinking our journey for amida 's virtue of instructions about forward to , there is great faith . 
the nenbutsu through ( buddhist invocation ) the mind arises the birth of vow from . 
this great selected primal the threefold mind , the sincerity and trustfulness of vow , of vow and may also called the faith , which is amida 's instructions virtue our journey for on forward of vow be . 
the reason is this realization because comes about through tathagata 's powerful support ; completely the compassion and wisdom of power through . 
pure shinjin if is to be realized , it is a mindset that will not be innovated ; it will not be false or vain in . 
a sentient being extreme evil , profound , and gigantic , of will realize great joy and receive love and veneration all the honored sacred ones of . 
enlightenment 
to unveil , steadfast devotion with the , true understanding : it a is wonderful state achieved amida 's pure benefiting others of through ; it the is supreme nirvana of ultimate flowering . 
it the the achievement required nirvana ( the 11th vow ) of of vow from blooms . 
also it is known the vow achieving great nirvana as . 
they because live the truly settled among , they attain nirvana . 
to attain nirvana is to achieve eternal bliss . 
eternal bliss the is ultimate tranquility . 
tranquility is supreme nirvana . 
supreme nirvana the is eternal dharma-body . 
the eternal dharma-body is true reality . 
true reality the is nature dharma of . 
the dharma of nature is suchness . 
suchness is oneness . 
amida tathagata suchness from emerges and is various bodies in manifested ; transformed , accommodated , and fulfilled . 
can as the above , how foolish beings attain birth the pure land in from be seen is explained teaching , practice , faith , and enlightenment through . 
this does not mean practice when foolish beings direct their merit attaining birth toward , but is the practice fulfilled when amida instructs out great compassion of . 
faith is not the belief foolish beings that have amida in , but is what is instructed them to the the primal vow of power by . 
similarly , it explained is enlightenment that is what is attained amida by and is directed living beings to .
