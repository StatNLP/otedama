honen : " kanmuryoju shaku kyo " ( of kanmuryoju kyo commentary ) 
tarikihongan amitabha in faith by ( salvation ) has following meanings the : 
first meaning the is the " hongan , or " original vow pranidhana amida buddha by made the or , amitabha . 
foundation jodo kyo of the idea this amida in its belief with provides teachings pure land ( ) . 
the meaning second others on is " relying " . and " letting their course take things " 
converted the original meaning mentioned above from these usages are . 
at present , the phrase " tariki hongan mentioned above the meanings of types both for " is used . 
such are groups both meanings of " daijirin as popular dictionaries japanese-japanese in or , found " are used generally " kojien " and . 
each meaning detail in is described below . 
second " , 他力本願 of riki " as is which pronounced , the character 力 means " 力用 rikiyu " and work indicates . 
this sense in tariki ( other power ) means work the others by not oneself by , but done . 
" , the vow original hongan " with when " is combined word the " tariki , and makes phrase " hongan , the " tariki " " of tariki the meaning however , is completely different . 
ken jodo into look shinjitsu kyogyosho monrui true ( the of the pure land way teaching , practice and realization ) shinran by written us let . 
shinran wrote , " tariki means power the original vow amida by made of the or work . " 
interpreted the jodo kyo of priests the the original vow amida buddha by made of the work as so tariki . 
amida buddha by himself made hongan of the power of because , mankind is able be in the pure land born to . 
called " it why is tariki ( other power ) hongan that is . " 
" " tariki exactly vow the power the original of " means amida buddha by made . " 
birth the pure land in that be would 's one own work by acts not accomplished or to mean is furthermore it . thought 
" of tariki " antonym the ( other power ) is " jiriki in this sense " ( self power ) . 
that were because of amida buddha of the wisdom from which came , compassion or hongan of the power people alive he also taught . 
tariki hongan of meanings of the second group the context in mainly a religious background without , is used and letting their course things take relying others " " on or indicates " " . 
below are examples the . 
. may in olympus optical co , 2002 , ltd ( present-day olympus corporation ) . advertisement the " a newspaper in nationwide circulation with let tariki hongan from us get away phrase , " using an ran .

shinran myogo the set and the honzon as ( buddha of principal image ) , nine six - , - and ten-letter myogo created . 
is the shandao of six characters of interpretation by shown , mentioned as above an it interpretation . 
" to mankind among those of the wishes namu ' believe who ' gan " refers and buddha amida . 
" of to ascetic the practices buddha amida " gyo refers mankind of the salvation for . 
ki " refers " ( ) namu the faith to of mankind . 
" to amida buddha of honganriki ( of the original vow power ) ho " refers , who saves the ( amidabutsu ) mankind . 
is ki mankind and ho amida buddha of of have that inseparably united and become ' amidabutsu namu an it interpretation . ' 
shomyo means invocation the buddha and / or bodhisattva of the name ( ) s of the . 
shomyo especially means butsu namu the amida buddha of ( name ) myogo which is amida , reciting and amida buddha to signifies homage . 
( many buddhas ) shobutsu admiration and praise with ( is shobutsu shomyo the forty-eight vows amida buddha by made of the seventeenth in ) that chant amida buddha of name the sometimes shomyo indicates . 
jodo ( pure land ) sect in , shomyo particularly means amida buddha ( namu amida butsu ) of the name invoking . 
( rightly established a practice ) in order the pure land in reborn to be go name this invoking is a shojo no . 
shomyo was the the hongan ( the original vow ) in amida that vowed act because ( a rightly established practice go ) it , no a shojo was argued , he . 
salvation for chanting achievements buddha 's name of the power on solely used prayer in when to relate seen but , was on reflecting about was not . 
thus , it certainly is the shojo no goin ( the rightly established cause ) . 
shinran explained of the pure land in the birth ' , faith is the proper cause , and one amida 's name invokes amida buddha of the benevolence in repay order to . ' 
( proper is cause [ shinjin shoin faith the ] . , shomyo hon [ invocation to repay benevolence the . ] is it called is ) 
buddhism than other the belief about , find one can many descriptions suffering escape one that can and relief gods and buddhas of the names invoking sacred books the taoism of in by receive . 
( one something similar can the muslim world in find also . ) 
jodo ( pure land ) concept world a clean and pure to pointed which a is buddhist . 
" called it is " also josetsu , " jokoku " or " jokai . " 
land impure ( buddhism in to edo word this is heteronymous . ) 
( defiled land ) , ekoku land a ) eaku with filled ( impurities edo the as to jodo opposed , , is called also . 
describes desert and undeveloped wastelands such as , lands , ekoku as it . 
this place in , human beings the have tied themselves . up , knowing they delusional are without delusions at looking 
, with they are obsessed and suffered from , these delusions . , and bonno ( earthly desires ) of world this the is 
as to edo , feel material any and spiritual being well not where people can opposed , jodo ( pure land ) clean is a pure land . 
pure land of this sort legitimate buddha of land the is . 
hence , the buddha-land jodo is . 
pureness the the world of , this from seen as spirituality on depends . 
thus , the land of the purity or impurity who live there residents the of the spirit by dictated is . 
hence , legitimate jodo the is the , buddha resides and place land to becoming a buddha who is devoted bosatsu ( bodhisattva ) of the . 
from view of this point , jodo buddha of is the land . 
however , buddha of the land although jodo is , buddha of the land jodo is not necessarily . 
buddha of the land , hence world buddha 's edificatory purpose for the is also , be bonpu ( ordinary unenlightened person ) of the world could buddha of the land . 
this means buddha of lands the indicate buddha and edificatory worlds all of adobe the . 
hence , jodo the of attaining buddha a to become bosatsu is the world . 
various to various jodo devoted traditions are there . 
amongst them , the amida buddha 's " seiho gokuraku jodo ( the west pure land ) " famous one is a . 
in that sense , the ( pure land ) word ' jodo ' is a noun proper a common noun rather than . 
world the the impure of hinders ascetic training in the becoming a buddha from . 
that is jodo to why each buddha leads one and these buddhist order in benefits provides make to easier to do it training ascetic . 
in this sense , jodo the buddha 's satisfaction for others of the benefit for , and is a place - satisfaction both parties for the . 
this world in these jodo are not , that we live in but built another world in . 
people their life this world in , when ends hence only go there , concept the jodo ojo ( in the pure land birth ) of exists . 
significantly , the 's amida-buddha seiho gokuraku jodo forms the jodo sect which the ojo jodo of the position takes . 
another school thought of the world to jodo shift that will is as , , teaches that jodo of the building about teaching another world in rather than there is . 
example for , " hokkekyo ( lotus sutra ) " alter to to the jodo world ( shabasoku jakko ) of lapis lazuli of land the this corrupt world preaches . 
this concept taken was shaka ( shkyamuni ) of the ryozen jodo and birushana-butsu ( vairocana ) of the lotus matrix world by . 
a certain sense in , to jodo places these conform . 
, and enlightenment being buddha by led through attain to that jodo to go , is jodo of the belief .
