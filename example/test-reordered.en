the dhyana meditation gradually deepened , " sanmyo ( three insights ) " appeared in zammai , and he was ultimately able to attain shinri . 
this , shaka through became the awakened one ( kakusha ) , or buddha .

anyone who awakens to recognize " i am evil " is truly awakened the truth by .

honen : " kanmuryoju kyo shaku " ( kanmuryoju kyo of commentary ) 
tarikihongan ( faith by salvation amitabha in ) has the following meanings : 
the first meaning is the " hongan , " the original vow or pranidhana made amida buddha by , or amitabha . 
this idea provides the jodo kyo of foundation ( pure land teachings ) its amida in belief with . 
relying the second meaning is " others on " and " letting things take their course . " 
these usages are converted the original meaning mentioned above from . 
present at , the phrase " tariki hongan both the meanings mentioned above of types for " is used . 
both meanings of groups are found popular japanese-japanese dictionaries in such " as daijirin " or " kojien , " and are used generally . 
each meaning is described below detail in . 
the second character 力 , which is pronounced " as riki , " 他力本願 of means 力用 " rikiyu " and indicates work . 
this sense in tariki ( other power ) means the work done others by , but by not oneself . 
however , when " with hongan , " the original vow the word " tariki " is combined , and makes the phrase " tariki hongan , " the " of tariki meaning " is completely different . 
let us ken jodo into look shinjitsu kyogyosho monrui ( the true teaching , practice and realization the pure land way of ) written shinran by . 
shinran wrote , " tariki means the power or work the original vow made amida by of . " 
so the the jodo kyo of priests interpreted tariki the the original vow made amida buddha by of work as . 
of because the hongan made amida buddha by himself of power , mankind is able to be born the pure land in . 
that is why it tariki ( other power ) hongan is called " . " 
" tariki " exactly means of the power the original " vow made amida buddha by . " 
furthermore it is thought to mean that birth the pure land in would one 's own work by not be accomplished or acts . 
jiriki the " of tariki antonym " ( other power ) is " in this sense " ( self power ) . 
that people were alive of because the compassion or hongan of power , which the amida buddha of wisdom from came he also taught . 
the second group meanings tariki hongan of of is mainly used the context in a religious background without , and indicates " relying on others " or " letting things take their course . " 
below are the examples . 
in may 2002 , olympus optical co . , ltd . ( present-day olympus corporation ) ran an advertisement using the phrase " a newspaper in let us get away tariki hongan from , " nationwide circulation with . 
the shinshu temples of federation ( shinshu kyodan rengo ) made a protest the corporation against saying , " the the ad in expression hurts the many the shinshu sect of followers of feelings . " 
the protest after , olympus apologized its consideration of lack for . 
from ( the asahi newspaper , may 28 , 2005 ) 
" amida-kyo sutra " ( amida buddha of sutra ) is one of sutras mahayama of buddhism . 
its original title was " sukharvativyuha sutra " ( sanskrit in sukhāvatīvyūha ) , which means ' the gokuraku of solemnity ( the pure land ) . '

" taisho shinshu daizo-kyo sutra " ( taisho tripitaka ) ( hereinafter referred " as taishozo " to ) : volume 12 , pp.346-348 . 
the existent translations among , this is the one that reflects the original most faithfully . 
first , it preaches the gokuraku jodo ( the land perfect bliss of ) , where amida-nyorai resides of solemnity . 
next , it exhorts to embrace the amida buddha of name in order and to leave this world be the pure land in born . 
finally , it exhorts various buddha roppo-sekai ( literally , the six directions of worlds ) to this praise and sincerity with teaching in believe in .

tan-luan was a buddhist monk who the the northern and southern dynasties of period during lived china in . 
he is thought to be the founder jodo ( pure land ) sect china in of . 
he was born yanmen ( present-day daixian , shanxi province , china ) to mt . wutai shan close in . 
it is not known when he when he died was born or , but that he lived a the latter half the northern wei period of in year from to the northern qi period it is thought . 
he was the first patriarch the five patriarchs jodo sect of of , and the the seven patriarchs jodo shin shu ( true pure land sect buddhism ) of of third . 
however , while he was annotating " mahsamnipata sutra , " he became sick . 
he studied the secret art eternal youth and longevity of tao maoshan in hong-jing and obtained ' sengyo ( taoist bible ) from . ' 
the way back home on he met bodhiruci luoyang in . 
that it was buddhism that contained the true teachings eternal life of , and gave him " kan muryoju-kyo sutra " ( meditation sutra ) bodhiruci persuaded him . 
therefore , tan-luan burned ' sengyo ( taoist bible ) , ' and was converted to jodo sect . 
imperial order by he was buried text valley ( 文谷 ) west qinling ( 西秦陵 ) fenzhou in of at . 
( to be precise the pure land " itself was the commentary " on sutra immeasurable life " ; tan-luan of on , " treatise annotated the commentary again . ) 
he argued that the mappo ( the end the dharma of ) of days in a buddha without , one through only birth the pure land in could attain nirvana believing tariki ( other power ) in by . 
the the second volume of end at , he proved that other power was the source everything of so logically and explicitly that one would feel as if the dominoes one was watching falling down one another after . 
the priests who followed him as such tao-chuo and shan-dao as well as genshin , honen japan in , and shinran adopted tan-luan 's logic their own theories of because its persuasiveness in . 
most all , his theory of forms the shinran 's doctrine of basis . 
ge " ( praise in hymns amida buddha of ) is a tribute to amida poetic verse in tathagata " san amida butsu . 
he declared that one should discard the difficult path and take the easy path where one entrusts everything to amida 's power described the original vow in . 
thus he established the jodo sect of doctrine . 
dao-chuo ( doshaku ) was a chinese monk chinese jodo ( pure land ) sect the tang in . 
he was the second the five founders the jodo sect of and the fourth founder the seven eminent monks the jodo shinshu ( the true buddhism of pure land sect ) of of of . 
he became a monk 14 age of years at and was nehan-gyo sutra ( the sutra the great nirvana of ) in well-versed . 
later , he engaged ascetic practices in the esan of guidance under . 
when , saw age 48 at , he donran 's inscription genchu-ji temple at and realized , then abandoned self-training , became a the jodo sect of believer and stayed the temple at . 
he gave than more 200 lectures to monks and lay believers " on kanmuryoju-kyo sutra " ( of the sutra ' visualization the measureless life , ' meaning amida of buddha of ) .

engi 
engi buddhism in 
it is described the section in below . 
these meanings , as such ' enginaoshi ' one 's luck ( to change ) and ' engimono ' manners and customs from ( lucky charm ) can be seen . 
it is also used to mean origin and history , and it shows the shrines and temples of histories , as well as the merits appearing those shrines and temples in of legends . 
the word is an abbreviation ' for innenshoki ' ( fate and occurrence ) , ' ' in ( 因 ) meaning the cause and ' en ' ( 縁 ) meaning the condition . 
to buddhist scriptures according , shaka mentioned engi as shown below . 
the engi which i came to embrace of ｐrinciple is deeply mysterious and subtle the same time at , and as such , it is hard to grasp and realize its true meaning an ordinary person for . 
engi is created by neither me nor any other person . 
as a famous poem to express engi , it is preached " in jisetsu-kyo " ( sutra what shakyamuni preached himself by nobody asking questions with ) as shown below . 
for there is " shi " ( this ) , hi there is " " that ( ) , " without shi and , " there can not be " hi . " 
when " shi " arises , " hi " also appears , and when " shi " perishes , " hi " also disappears . 
this shows that the " of hi " existence ( that ) is regulated " by shi " ( this ) . 
the two phrases existence and nothingness of put together is neither a rhetorical ornament nor a literary expression . 
it is because if someone is not born neither age nor , he can die . 
initially , engi the 12 innen ( destinies ) a person 's life of as was preached shaka by . 
engi is sometimes interpreted a preaching that corresponds to people 's wish to be taught , or ' kien sekki as . ' 
example for kegon doctrine in , it 's called ' engi inbun . ' 
shandao clarified the interpretation ( the six characters of interpretation ) six letters combining two ' of namu letters ( 南無 ) ' and four ' of amidabutsu letters ( 阿弥陀仏 ) in . ' 
shinran set the myogo the honzon as ( principal image buddha of ) , and created six - , nine - and ten-letter myogo . 
it is an interpretation shown interpretation the six characters shandao of of by , as mentioned above . 
" gan " refers to the those mankind among of wishes who believe ' namu ' and amida buddha . 
" to the ascetic practices of gyo " refers amida buddha the mankind of salvation for . 
" to the faith of ki " refers mankind ( namu ) . 
" ho " refers to honganriki amida buddha of ( the original vow of power ) , who saves the mankind ( amidabutsu ) . 
it is an interpretation that ki mankind and ho amida buddha of of have inseparably united and become ' namu amidabutsu . ' 
shomyo means the the name ( s ) the buddha and / or bodhisattva of of invocation . 
shomyo especially means reciting namu amida butsu , which is the myogo ( name ) amida buddha of and signifies homage to amida buddha . 
that shobutsu ( many buddhas ) chant the amida buddha of name admiration and praise with ( shobutsu shomyo is the the forty-eight vows made amida buddha by of seventeenth in ) sometimes shomyo indicates . 
jodo ( pure land ) sect in , shomyo particularly means invoking the amida buddha ( namu amida butsu ) of name . 
go ( a rightly established practice ) in the pure land in order to be reborn this name invoking is a shojo no . 
because shomyo that amida vowed the hongan ( the original vow ) in was the act , it was a shojo no go ( a rightly established practice ) , he argued . 
chanting salvation for about was not reflecting achievements but , was seen to relate solely the buddha 's name of power on when prayer in used on . 
thus , it certainly is the shojo no goin ( the rightly established cause ) . 
shinran explained , ' faith is the proper cause the the pure land in birth of , and one invokes amida 's name in order to repay the amida buddha of benevolence . ' 
( it is called shinjin shoin [ faith is the proper cause . ] , shomyo hon [ invocation is to repay the benevolence . ] ) 
other buddhism than , one the belief about can find many descriptions that one can escape suffering and receive invoking the sacred books taoism of in the gods and buddhas of names by relief . 
( one can the muslim world in find something similar also . ) 
jodo ( pure land ) is a buddhist concept which pointed to a world clean and pure . 
it is also called " josetsu " , " jokoku " or " jokai . " 
this word is heteronymous to edo ( impure land buddhism in . ) 
the edo , as opposed to jodo , ekoku ( defiled land ) , a land filled eaku with ( impurities ) is also called . 
it describes lands as such desert and undeveloped wastelands , , as ekoku . 
this place in , the human beings have tied themselves up , looking knowing they are delusional without delusions at . 
they are obsessed with , and suffered from , these delusions , and this is the world bonno ( earthly desires ) of . 
as opposed to edo , where people can not feel any material and spiritual well being , jodo ( pure land ) is a pure clean land . 
this pure land of sort is the legitimate land buddha of . 
hence , jodo is the buddha-land . 
as this from seen , the the world of pureness depends spirituality on . 
thus , the purity or impurity the land of is dictated the the residents who live there of spirit by . 
hence , the legitimate jodo is the place buddha resides , and the bosatsu ( bodhisattva ) who is devoted to becoming a buddha of land . 
this view of point from , jodo buddha of is the land . 
however , although buddha of jodo is the land , the buddha of land is not necessarily jodo . 
the buddha 's edificatory purpose for world is also the land buddha of , hence , the bonpu ( ordinary unenlightened person ) of world could be the land buddha of . 
this means the buddha of lands indicate the buddha and all edificatory worlds of adobe . 
hence , the jodo bosatsu attaining to become a buddha of is the world . 
there are various traditions to various jodo devoted . 
amongst them , the amida buddha 's " seiho gokuraku jodo ( the west pure land ) " is a famous one . 
that sense in , the word ' jodo ' ( pure land ) is a common noun rather than a proper noun . 
the the impure of world hinders the training in ascetic becoming a buddha from . 
that is why each buddha and leads one to jodo provides these buddhist benefits order in to make it easier to do ascetic training . 
this sense in , the jodo buddha 's satisfaction for , and the others of benefit for is a place - the both parties for satisfaction . 
these jodo are not this world in that we live in , but built another world in . 
people only go there when their life hence ends this world in , , the ojo jodo ( the pure land in birth ) of concept exists . 
significantly , the amida-buddha 's seiho gokuraku jodo forms the jodo sect which takes the the ojo jodo of position . 
there is another thought of school that than rather the jodo of building about teaching another world in , , teaches that the world will shift to jodo as is . 
example for , " hokkekyo ( lotus sutra ) " preaches to alter this corrupt world to the lapis the jodo world ( shabasoku jakko ) of lazuli of land . 
this concept was taken the ryozen jodo shaka ( shkyamuni ) of and the lotus matrix world birushana-butsu ( vairocana ) of by . 
a certain sense in , these places conform to jodo . 
to go to that jodo , and attain being buddha by led through enlightenment , is the belief jodo of .

gokuraku ' and ' sukhaavatii ' are sanskrit words used that amida nyorai established to refer to the jodo ( pure land ) . 
in " amida-kyo sutra , " it is said that ' the place is called gokuraku , there is no shuku but only shoraku ( all kinds enjoyment of ) since . ' 
shinran ' about gokuraku mui nehankai commented ' " in yuishinsho-moni " ( notes faith on alone ) as shown below . 
gokuraku ' is that peaceful pure land , where joy is always around and come pain does not near . 
that place is called anyo , and donran kasho said that praise with ' , i call the place anyo . ' 
' nehankai in , ' perplexity light without is changed to satori ( enlightenment ) mujonehan ( absolute nirvana ) with . 
kai ' is a border , or the enlightenment of border . 
other words in , gokuraku , relatively speaking , is a peaceful place feeling and the body for , as opposed to pain the real world in . 
the absolute sense in , gokuraku pain or joy , which is called mui nehan kai ( enlightenment of world absolutely permanent existence of ) without is a world . 
called a world ' filled happiness with gokuraku can be . ' 
therefore , people the old times since have referred to this various ways in place . 
listed below are some other common names gokuraku for . 
jodo ( pure land )

hodo 
gokuraku is explained detail in ' jodo sanbu-kyo ' ( the three main sutras the pure land sect of ) in . 
because the gokuraku of atmosphere is described particular " in bussetsu amida-kyo detail " ( the sutra amida buddha of ) with , the it of summary is described below based this sutra on . 
the time goes up ten kalpa before , and amida nyorai completed the path to becoming attaining enlightenment by a buddha and established a a billion buddha-lands over place at jodo the west in . 
and even now , he preaches people this gokuraku in for . 
further , they are very pure and shine very brightly . 
consequently this jodo in , there is no pain , but only joy exists . 
this world in , all the people have muryoju ( immeasurable life ) and muryoko ( immeasurable light ) , buddha like , and there is to their wisdom and mercy no limit . 
summary in , people the jodo sect in see gokuraku hodo as ; moreover , common people can also enter this hodo . 
in also the tendai sect , jodo amitabha of is regarded a land where common people and saints both exist as , and it 's a land retsuojin ( an inferior manifested body of buddha ) of . 
people the jodo sect in basically see gokuraku hodo anrakushu in ( a collection passages concerning birth the pure land in of ) as , doshaku by . 
jodo is hodo .

however , people jodo-mon ( the pure land of gateway ) in make jodo jiso ( phenomenon ) of and hold the position that they see buddha their hearts outside . 
course of , even though people jodo-mon of say that gokuraku is jodo jiso of , they say it still matches the buddhist thought muso without ( any shape ) of . 
the jodo-mon this like of position shows religious thoughts that are different shodo-mon from .

eon and kyogo 
broken the 48 vows have been down three eon and kyogo by categories , china of into . 
the name and grouping each category of is as follows : 
shoboshingan and kyubutsushingan ( 求仏身願 ) : buddha to perfect the body buddha of for , vows 12 , 13 and 17 
setsujodogan ( 摂浄土願 ) ・ kyubutsudogan ( 求仏土願 ) : completion the buddha land , which allows sentient beings to be reborn in of : vows 31 and 32 
shinran 
shinran japan of , , broke down the 48 vows reality into and apotheosis . 
these vows were developed to resolve the all the sorrows and suffering sentient beings of observed that had been of problems . 
that satisfaction is derived the effects other directions in for expectedhope from a an individual 's good deeds of result as this refers to the concept . 
though the good deeds of karma to come back to oneself is essentially supposed , everything is regarded being mahayana buddhism in empty as , so it is possible to turn the karma to others . 
that is to say , turning and giving charity and merit that one pursues to others , is called eko . 
this is why the envelope says " eko ryo ( a memorial service for fee ) " when hiring a temple or a sutra chanting for priest . 
the ascetic the eko of mind with practices of levels are divided , ten which juekoi are called " ( ten eko levels ) into " and are important ascetic enlightenment for practices of processes as regarded . 
the charity one pursues is turned to buddhahood to remove self-obsession . 
" charity " is always turned the others of directions in , and turns " into merit , " then self-centeredness is removed . 
this is the inevitability eko of . 
it is not to mean that the charity of accumulation becomes buddha , but that all charity has meaning having eko in . 
eko generally consists three kinds ; ( 1 ) bodai eko ( awakening eko ) , ( 2 ) syujo eko ( mankind eko ) , ( 3 ) jissai eko ( reality eko ) of . 
they are supposed to lead to awakening , to give merit to mankind , and to pursue the absolutely permanent existence of enlightenment , respectively . 
this altruistic attainment is also done eko by amida buddha 's honganriki ( original vow of power ) with . 
therefore , both oso and genso have eko , transmitting to mankind buddha the from merit amida buddha 's honganriki by . 
" tariki eko this is called ( other-power with eko ) . " 
specifically the edo period sanuki province in during , , a pious jodo shinshu sect believer named shoma said ; ' there are those that are happy to make use the buddha i have discarded of . ' 
" ekobun , " which is also called " ekoge , " refers to gemon ( metrical style teachings of ) chanted the a devotion of end at or a memorial service . 
to provide eko widely involved people for , not only to give the a buddhist rite of merit to those who hold it it is recited . 
this sense in , a buddhist rite held a temple or each household in has eko for not only the deceased , but all the people involved for . 
gebun religious doctrines among varies . 
- " the lotus sutra , " the third volume ' kejoyuhon number seven ' kumaraju by translated ( " taisho shinshu ninth daizo-kyo sutra " the volume p24 . ) 
- " kammuryojukyosho , " ' kangyogengibun the first volume ' written shandao ( " taisho shinshu daizo-kyo sutra " by the thirty-seventh volume p246 . ) 
since the the jodo ( pure land ) sect of schools have the jodo sanbu-kyo ( the three main sutras the pure land sect of ) the main scripture as , the latter is used . 
and the jodo shinshu sect take " this merit " the amida buddha of merit as . 
ojo is a methodology becoming a buddha for , as the mahayana buddhism by defined . 
there are various pure rebirth for lands of interpretations , but it generally means the buddhist paradise that is considered to be the pure land amida buddha of . 
kesho is one the four categories birth creatures for of of ; ransho , shissho and kesho the others are taisho . 
taisho : to come out the mother 's body of , as humans and animals with . 
ransho : to be hatched eggs from , as birds with 
shissho : to come out a moist environment of , as insects with 
kesho : to existence a converted form in into come a one 's past actions of consequence as 
as such celestial beings 
to be reincarnated the the karma that is generated that land in of result as that to be born the pure land amitabha of in means it is said . 
renge kesho means to be reincarnated surrounded the pure land amitabha of in lotus ( renge ) flowers by . 
original meaning 
the original meaning ojo of is to go to the buddha ( india ) of country , to become a buddha , and to attain enlightenment be that land in born . 
to become a buddha but not to the pure land amitabha of simply to go thus the primary meaning ojo of is . 
inevitability 
buddhism in , to attain enlightenment is to attain the perfect self-effacement of state . 
to understand that he is empty one and nothing for , the ' of ego state ' should not exist while one is training in . 
assuming that it is impossible to attain buddhahood as long as there is ego-consciousness , it will be impossible to remove the ego-consciousness oneself by . 
it is the standpoint jodo-mon of ( the pure land of gateway ) that this is the reason one needs to meet and see buddha to attain buddhahood . 
the general meaning ' of ojo ' 
additionally , the world one goes to is the world buddha of , born so to be that world is to become a buddha in when he or she dies . 
given the foregoing , it is considered to become a buddha that ojo means . 
reality in , means to die and , moreover , to become a buddha because ojo , it is considered that the thought where one would become a buddha death upon of line became common . 
death to a natural cause due , as such succumbing to old age and particularly multiple organ failure to old age due , is often referred to a peaceful death as . 
that this ' of ojo definition ' became further secularized , so that it meant it is considered ' to be cornered and not know what to do . ' 
zenjo ( sanskrit , jhaana pali in in dhyaana ) is to meditate and observe the truth focusing one 's mind while . 
it also means the stability attained zenjo which under neither one 's mind nor body is unsettled anything by through . 
it is the compound term ' of zen , ' a sanskrit dhyaana of transcription , and its free translation ' jo , ' which has the same meaning zanmai as . 
originally , it was daigo zenna haramitsu ( paramita ) , one six haramitsu of that bosatsu ( bodhisattva ) mahayana buddhism of was obliged to practice . 
zenna ( dhyāna ) is translated ' as zenjo ' and means stabilizing thinking the truth by the unsettled mind . 
the attaining such a state of process in , to agama sutra according , there are four stages ranging shozen ( the first dhyana ) to daishizen ( the fourth dhyana ) from . 
these are collectively called ' shijoryo ' ( also referred shizen as ) . 
called ' shimushikijo ' ( four concentrations the formless realm of ) these are collectively and are kushidaijo ( nine successive stages concentration of ) and hyakuhachi zanmai ( one hundred eight kinds samadhi of ) by followed . 
( the zenjo and wisdom between relationship regarding , refer to shikan ( tendai meditation ) ) . 
the zen sect , which abolished zenjo practices and pursued tongo ( prompt enlightenment ) , was established china in . 
although this sect and brought forth a new definition zenjo ( i.e. , zazen ) of had the completely denying the existing buddhism of aspect , it prospered the the tang dynasty of era in . 
the zen sect was introduced japan into eisai and dogen by the the southern sung dynasty of period during .

the former four stages are collectively called ' shijoryo ' ( shizen ) , and the latter four stages are collectively called ' shimushikijo ' ( four concentrations the formless realm of ) . 
the above process is related to the hierarchical structure sangai ( three realms ) of : yokkai , the desire of realm ; shikikai , the form of realm ; and mushikikai , the non-form of realm . 
yokkai ( consciousness based desire on ) becomes ' sanchi ' the above process through . 
similarly , shikikai split four classes , shozenten ( first dhyana heaven ) , dainizenten ( second dhyana heaven ) , daisanzenten ( third dhyana heaven ) and daishizenten ( fourth dhyana heaven ) into . 
these comprise sangaikuji ( three realms and nine levels ) . 
to buddhist literature according , shakyamuni arrived the musho-usho and hisohihisosho of stage at soon after he entered the buddhist priesthood . 
however , because he was unsatisfied the above stage with he practiced kugyo ( asceticism ) , and then abandoning kugyo after , , he pursued a new way practice of . 
the initial mahayana buddhism emphasized sanmai and the importance ' of hyakuhachi zanmai ' ( one hundred eight kinds samadhi of ) etc . , were preached the prajnaparamita-sutra in . 
that stopping sanmai through mental function alone was meaningless buddhism for tendai the sui dynasty period in chigi , asserted .

genso-eko ( virtue as instructed to this world retiring the pure land from for amida by ) is one the important jodo sect doctrines ( the pure land of teachings ) of . 
it is one the two aspects eko ( amida tathagata 's directing virtue of ) of of . 
he continues to explain the two types eko of as follows . 
whether one or is going forth returning , it the leading sentient beings the birth-and-death of sea across of sake for is all entirely . 
therefore , ' it is to fulfill a compassionate mind accepting first priority as virtue by . ' 
broad meaning : 
interpreted that as , one is inclined to conceptualize something a spirit the pure land from which has returned to this world like . 
interpret it that way fact in some scholars do . 
this is the genso-eko the jodo sect of teachings in of primary a concept . 
also shinran " in a passages revealing the true teaching , the practice and realization the pure land way of " as follows of collection explains : 
benefiting returning from is an example one 's true intention benefiting others of of . 
this regard in , vasubandhu , the author , says the single broad unfettered mind awakens universally . 
reverently embrace these words ; receive deepest homage in them . 
as above , genso-eko ritagyo ( altruistic practices ) as should be interpreted . 
shinran further explains " in passages the pure land way on " as follows : 
second , genso-eko is benefit ritakyoke-chi to enlighten others ( competency to the true pure land for head ) of . 
it came out the 22th vow the 48 vows of from . 
also i named it issho fusho as no gan ( succession of vow to one lifetime after buddhahood ) or genso-eko no gan ( genso-eko of vow ) . 
as above , he points the 22 vow the 48 vows amida of from the his explanation for basis as . 
conclusion in , he explains that everything is fulfilled the amida 's primal vow of power by . 
devoting the true purpose the way of about our thinking to the pure land by , we can see that amida 's virtue of instructions to sentient beings have two aspects : 
to go forward to the pure land and the return to this world . 
to go forward , there is the teaching , practice , faith , and enlightenment the truth of . 
from ( " a collection passages that reveal the true lessons , practice of and understanding to the pure land way the " of ) 
each above of is explained shinran by as follows . 
teaching 
to unveil the true lessons : the larger sutra the immeasurable life on buddha of one must study . 
shakyamuni this world into came and preached the way to enlightenment , to save the living blessing by creatures of multitudes them benefits that are truthful and genuine with . 
so , to preach tathagata 's primal vow is the true intention this sutra of ; the essence the the buddha of name in is . 
practice 
devotedly amida 's instructions about thinking virtue the journey for on to the pure land , there is great practice , great faith . 
great reciting the name in practice tathagata of prevailing light of . 
embodying all good acts , possessing all the roots virtue of , is the most perfect and quickest way to birth about bring . 
it is a treasure house virtues that is the true reality of . 
and of because this , it is called great practice . 
this practice the great compassion ( 17th vow ) of vow from comes . 
faith 
to thinking our journey for amida 's virtue of instructions about forward unending devotion , there is great faith . 
the nenbutsu through ( buddhist invocation ) the mind arises the birth of vow from . 
this great selected primal the threefold mind , the sincerity and trustfulness of vow , of vow and may the faith , which is amida 's instructions virtue our journey for on forward of vow also be called . 
the reason is because this realization comes through about tathagata 's powerful support ; completely the compassion and wisdom of power through . 
if pure shinjin is to be realized , it is a mindset be that will not innovated ; be it will vain in not false or . 
great joy a sentient being extreme evil , profound , and gigantic , of will realize and receive love and veneration all the honored sacred ones of . 
enlightenment 
to unveil , steadfast devotion with , the true understanding : it is a wonderful state achieved amida 's pure benefiting others of through ; it is the ultimate flowering supreme nirvana of . 
it the the achievement required nirvana ( the 11th vow ) of of vow from blooms . 
also it is known the vow achieving great nirvana as . 
because they live the truly settled among , they attain nirvana . 
to attain nirvana is to achieve eternal bliss . 
eternal bliss is the ultimate tranquility . 
tranquility is supreme nirvana . 
supreme nirvana is the eternal dharma-body . 
the eternal dharma-body is true reality . 
true reality is the nature dharma of . 
the dharma of nature is suchness . 
suchness is oneness . 
amida tathagata suchness from emerges and is various bodies in manifested ; transformed , accommodated , and fulfilled . 
seen as can be the above , how foolish beings attain birth the pure land in from is explained teaching , practice , faith , and enlightenment through . 
mean this does not practice when foolish beings direct their merit attaining birth toward , but is the practice fulfilled out when amida instructs great compassion of . 
faith is not the belief that foolish beings have amida in , but is what is instructed to them the the primal vow of power by . 
similarly , it is explained is what is attained amida by and is directed to living beings that enlightenment .
