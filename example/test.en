history
the history of shingon sect yamashina school began from the foundation of the kanshu-ji temple .
it was guarded by the imperial family and produced distinguished priests who knew well about the practical training of the shinshu sect .

the cloistered imperial prince saihan , the thirty-second head priest , ( yamashina no miya imperial prince akira later returned to a secular life ) was the last miya-monzeki .
in 1470 during the muromachi period , the temple was destroyed by fire in a battle , but it was restored .

otani mausoleum is a graveyard in higashiyama ward , kyoto city , kyoto prefecture where the grave of shinran , the founder of the jodo shinshu ( the true pure land sect of buddhism ) is located .
it is commonly known as nishi otani .
( it is known because of the otani sobyo grave [ higashi otani ] which is said by the shinshu sect otani school [ higashi hongan-ji temple ] to be the graveyard of the founder shinran . )
it originated from the otani-byodo mausoleum ( later became hongan-ji temple ) , which was built as the mausoleum of shinran in otani , higashiyama ward in 1272 .
( the ' odabisho ' ( crematorium for shinran ) is in the precinct at the detached estate of the otani mausoleum . )
otani-byodo mausoleum ( later became hongan-ji temple ) was built as the mausoleum of shinran in 1272 .
( the details of the history of hongan-ji temple can be referred to on the page of the history about hongan-ji temple . )
otani hongan-ji temple was destroyed by the monk-soldiers of the enryaku-ji temple saito , west tower in 1465 .
after the temple was destroyed , the original grave was kept safe by a person called ganchi inoue and was called otani dojo .
when yamashina hongan-ji temple was destroyed in the tenbun war in 1532 , the otani dojo was also destroyed .
it was restored by yugan , a descendant of ganchi inoue .
otani dojo was destroyed again during the ishiyama war in 1571 .
yusei moved the mi-do hall ( enshrinement hall ) of otani dojo to shijo tomi-koji street by orders of kyonyo in 1600 prior to extending the buildings in chion-in temple .
then he founded tokusho-ji temple ( present tokushoji with different chinese characters , a temple for shinshu sect otani school ) .
after the alternate site was provided within the area of mt . toribe , zenryo founded shokyu-ji temple by building otani dojo anew .
shokyu-ji temple was placed under the umbrella of west hongan-ji temple in 1639 .
thereafter , shokyu-ji temple was maintained as the mausoleum of shinran for west hongan-ji temple and came to be called otani mausoleum ( nishi-otani ) .

kennin-ji temple
rokuji-raisan is a pure land sect buddhist memorial service .
it is a service carried out according to the six times of the day consisting of sutra chanting , nenbutsu recitation and prayer based on the ' ojoraisange ' of chinese monk shandao .
in the kamakura period , pure land sect founder honen put tunes to buddhist worship to create one of the nenbutsu-zanmai ( mental absorption in the nenbutsu ) practices .
it was characterized by the beautiful melody of the tendai shomyo ( buddhist liturgical chant ) with a high-pitched tone used in the second half to increase the sense of solemnity .
this practice became the reason for the religious persecution called jogen no honan ( kenei no honan ) .
today it is widely used in the services of the pure land sect , ji sect and jodo shinshu ( the true pure land sect of buddhism ) .
shinran 's shoshin nenbutsuge ( buddhist verses ) were created with inspiration from rokuji-raisan .
rokuji
the rokuji are generally considered to consist of the following six parts .
nichimotsu : saru-tori no koku ( from around 4 p.m. to around 6 p.m. )
shoya : inu-i no koku ( from around 8 p.m. to around 10 p.m. )
chuya or hanya : ne-ushi no koku ( from around midnight to around 2 a.m. )
goya : tora-u no koku ( from around 4 a.m. to around 6 a.m. )
jinjo / shincho : tatsu-mi no koku ( from around 8 a.m. to around 10 a.m. )
nicchu : uma-hitsuji no koku ( from around noon to around 2 p.m. )
the practice of conducting buddhist ceremonies according to the rokuji times of the day is not limited to the pure land sect and can also be seen in the shunie ceremony of todai-ji temple .
shisenin kosen ( year of birth and death unknown ) was busho ( japanese military commander ) , yamabushi ( a mountain priest ) and buddhist monk in the sengoku period ( the period of warring states . )
his real name was ietoshi shishido and he was from a family of the aki-shishido clan .
his father was the first motoie shishido in the later years of the shishido clan and his son was genjiro shishido .
he was a grand-uncle of takaie shishido who played an active role as a family of the mori clan .
much of his history was unclear , but he was born in a family of the aki-shishido clan .
he is thought to have served for masamoto hosokawa of the hosokawa-keicho family .
it is well known that masamoto hosokawa was really into shugendo ( japanese mountain asceticism-shamanism incorporating shinto and buddhist concepts , ) and that 's why shisenin kosen was invited because of his talent .
it is described in ' 後慈眼院殿御記 ' that kosen went to kyoto and taught masamoto the art of warfare .
this incident tells us that kosen seemed to have a significant power as masamoto 's close adviser .
meanwhile , kosen seemed to enter into priesthood , and sanetaka 's diary of the year 1509 states kosen became a priest .
kosen is thought to have flown in the air from iwaya , aki province on may 18 , 1570 , and decided to live on mt . atago in kyoto .
afterward , kosen is believed to have handed down the secret art to michiaki kawano .
the shisen shrine still exists that worships shisenin kosen in goryo-jo castle , as the base of the aki-shishido clan .
therefore , when he entered mt . atago in 1570 , he was thought to have been over the age of a hundred years .
satori ( 悟り : enlightenment ) means that one learns , becomes aware of or notices what one hasn 't known ; another kanji ( 覚り ) , whose meaning is similar to awakening , is sometimes used .
religious enlightenment means shinri , which is the obtainment of truth or the opposite of illusion .
in sanskrit , it is called ' bodhi . '
in japanese , it is also called ' bodai , ' ' kaigo ' or ' jodo , ' the abbreviation of ' jobutsuedo . '
buddhism
satori in buddhism is called bodhi in sanskrit , the original language of buddhism .
awakening of shinri ( law )
the opposite of illusion
from the earliest period of buddhism through to the emergence of sects , the ultimate aim of the satori ( enlightenment ) concept entailed putting into practice the pursuit of various forms of knowledge and disciplines .
this is how to attain enlightenment , which does not include thoughts or words .
however , in current day japanese buddhism ( this text included ) , there is discord about which character should be used .
shaka studied under many philosophers or people of religion and practiced asceticism , but he was unable to attain enlightenment .
the dhyana meditation gradually deepened , " sanmyo ( three insights ) " appeared in zammai , and he was ultimately able to attain shinri .
through this , shaka became the awakened one ( kakusha ) , or buddha .
the state of attaining enlightment is called ' nehan ( nirvana ) ' , which is described as ' jakujo ( quiet and peaceful ) . '
it means there is peace in the unoccupied mind , since bonno is controlled .
the mind that seeks enlightenment is said to aspire toward buddhahood .
it is also called ' awakening ' ; in the old translated version of hinayama , it is the translated from the word " vitarka " in sanskrit .
vitarka is also translated as " jin , " meaning the rough action of the mind that presumes and judges objects .
both of them hinder concentration but disappear as dhyana meditation deepens .
in the mahayana sutra , ' awakening ' is a translation of ' bodhi . '
it is transliterated as the word ' bodai ' ; it means awakening or the wisdom of awakening .
in the ancient times , it was translated as " do , " " i " or " kakui . "
mahayana buddhism maintains a , stance based on an assumption that the satori of others is proceeded by ones own enlightenment .
as such , emphasis is placed on bodhisattva ( compassion ) amongst the so called rokuharamitsu ( six virtues of buddha ) where altruism is put into practice .
chinese buddhism
however , because northern chinese zen was abandoned earlier , the version handed-down to japan comes from the sect that aligns itself with the practice of southern chinese zen that advocated sudden enlightenment .
however , as the version that was handed down to japan emanated from the song dynasty , for a time zen lost much of its substance and differs greatly from its heyday during the tang dynasty .
for example , neither the rinzai sect or the soto sect inherited very much of the respective paths toward enlightenment as espoused by rinzai and soto .
another major stream of chinese buddhism is the jodo ( pure land ) sect however , this sect is a reflection of the influences of the times .
dying a happy death is a keen aspiration of amitabha jodo buddhism whereas , satori is not a major aim .
it was transmitted into japan during the heian period , and the religion seeking gokuraku ojo ( peaceful death ) spread among the aristocracy .
as an aside , the esoteric buddhist concept of avidya ( ignorance ) comes after the beginning-less ( mushi ) concept and as such , lack of dependence is called ' shikaku ' ( acquired enlightenment ) .
however , if one 's nature is in principle primarily pure then ' hongaku ' ( fundamental enlightenment ) may occur which in turn can by chance be concealed by avidya .
thus , it is explained that it is not going to far to say that shikaku is no different to hongaku and , depending on the manifestation of shikaku may meld into hongaku .
namely , it preaches that the way toward awakening is open to anyone but that the practice to achieve it is necessary .
it also explains that awakening is clean and pure , which is the characteristic of this book .
jainism
hinduism is a varied and complex religion with a long history seeking enlightenment since the age of veda .
in contrast to buddhism , veda-related religion refers to enlightenment as the state of consciousness , one of the supreme states that human beings can attain .
it corresponds to nehan in sanskrit .
it is also called komyo or daigo .
it is called komyo because a person may be wrapped in dazzling light when he or she attains enlightenment .
in india , since the age of veda , ' the sciences by which to attain enlightenment ' have been sought .
they are described in upanishad , etc . , using philosophical expressions .
the existence that attains the enlightenment of ancient times is called rishi .
it is said that there are three stages in nirvana , among which mahapari-nirvana is considered the highest .
enlightenment seems to refer to each respective stage .
it is said that the state of mind is not lost , no matter which stage one reaches .
sometimes enlightment refers to a mysterious experience of having a glimpse of the world of nirvana .
this case is not included in nirvana but is called pseudo nirvana .
even today , many practitioners conduct ascetic training over hill and dale , just as occurred in the age of buddha gautama .
anywhere and at any time , there will be people who believe they have attained considerable enlightenment and will therefore call refer to themselves as enlightened .
those believed to have attained enlightenment usually stayed in the tradition of hinduism , or brahmanism , its previous stage .
christianity
christianity does not include " enlightenment " but the experience of knowing the existence of god .
it is explained as a spiritual experience to re-enter interaction with god , although humanity left him when adam and eve , their forebears , ate the forbidden fruit .
the spirit mentioned here does not mean spirits of the dead but instead means the interaction with the spirit , one of the holy trinity .
it is the experience that is attained when one believes that jesus of nazareth is christ , the son of the god , who came to earth from heaven .
it means to experience god by following jesus , whose life is recorded in the bible and early christians .
gnosticism , which was blended with greek philosophy and so on and was once labeled as heretical , refers to the true recognition of god as attaining the direct acquaintance of god ( gnosis ) .
it is very close to or the same as what is known as the process of enlightment .
she writes very objectively , in general terms , about the process that occurred to her .
terms from veda are not used , so it 's easy for lay people to comprehend .
in some streams of veda , jesus of nazareth is respected as the existence who has attained enlightment .
new age
islam
however , some sufis who accomplished their aim declared , ' i am god ' and were executed by general islamists .

kanbutsue is a ceremony that celebrates the birth of buddha .
it is held on april 8 every year .
it is based on the tradition that says buddha ( gotama siddhattha ) was born on april 8 ( old lunar calendar ) .
it is based on the tradition that dragons came down from the sky to pour koto ( fragrant hot water ) ( soma , amrita ) when buddha was born .
this ceremony should be held based on the old lunar calendar in nature .
it started to be celebrated more often based on the solar calendar or on sunday that is closer to the date in recent years in japan .
korea still holds the ceremony based on the old lunar calendar , and designates the day as a statutory holiday known as ' buddha 's birthday . '
christmas has been designated as a statutory holiday .
as a result , consideration was given not to give special treatment to one particular religion .
another tradition tells that buddha was born on february 8 ( old lunar calendar ) ( the second month of the indian calendar , vaisakha ) .
custom
in japan , people make a hanamido ( literally , " blossom temple " ) decorated with various plants and flowers .
inside the hanamido , a kanbutsu-oke tub is placed to be filled with amacha ( hydrangea tea ) .
a buddhist statue is placed at the center and amacha is poured over it with a tea ladle as a celebration .
the event can take place at any temple irrespective of the sect ( with the exception of the nichiren sho sect 's fujimon school ( where buddha is not the principal deity ) ) .
worshippers are also offered amacha .
amacha is believed to help people improve their calligraphy skills .
it is also used as a charm to repel pests .
theravada buddhism and tibetan buddhism hold vesakh festival and saga wada festival around may , respectively , as an equivalent of kanbutsue .
on the other hand , the nichiren shoshu sect holds ' the birthday party ' on february 16 , when nichiren was born .
at taiseki-ji temple , after a memorial service is held at the goei-do hall ( hall dedicated to the sect 's founder ) , a sutra is recited to open the five-storied pagoda .
the notation of hanamatsuri was adopted by the jodo sect during the meiji period .
since then , it has been used to refer to kanbutsue regardless of sects .
the notation is more familiar among nursery schools and kindergartens run by temples .
the day is for children to be given amacha .
also , many temples feature chigogyoretsu ( children 's parade ) .
in japanese , to ruin things by mistake is described as ' oshaka-ni-naru ( becoming buddha ) , ' which relates to kanbutsue .
smithies in edo used the patter to describe failed metallic products due to overroasting .

ordinary people are the objects of amidanyorai 's salvation .
ordinary people are all ' evil ' people filled with passions and struggling to live in the latter days of buddhism , in a world stained by defilement .
in order to understand the meaning of the dogma of ' the salvation of evil people , ' it is extremely important that one knows how to interpret ' good people ' and ' bad people . '
the " good and evil " mentioned here doesn 't include legal or moral problems .
neither does it mean good and evil in the general or common sense .
it means good and evil from budda 's point of view .
evil people
only then are they led to recognize that they are ' evil ' for the first time .
good people
good people ' are defined as those who think of themselves as ' good . '
good people ' are interpreted as ' evil people ' who aren 't ready to recognize that they can 't complete any good deeds .
( refer to presumption upon the primal vow )
karma
cause ( in ) ' is brought about by ordinary people , and ' relationship ( en ) ' can bring about an unexpected ' result ( ka ) . '
evil people can 't foresee what kind of result ( ka ) will be brought about .
( extracted and paraphrased )
namely , every person is the object of salvation .
the good and evil deeds they do are not conditions for salvation .
our action is nothing but evil in itself , as is shown below .
we try to do something good because we doubt the primal vow of amida buddha .
whatever we may do , we can 't be free from desires ( earthly desires ) ; any deed based upon them is nothing but evil ( bonnojoku : defiled passion ) .
even when trying to do good deeds , it was not just a matter knowing the criteria for good and bad but , in essence there was no set basis of judgment of good or evil .
namely , the essential part of ' the thought that the most wicked are the true object of salvation ' is as follows :
anyone who awakens to recognize " i am evil " is truly awakened by the truth .
however , this thought should be interpreted with care , since it 's likely to be misunderstood as follows : you can do evil things depending on your desires .
( refer to presumption upon the primal vow )
it shows his distinctiveness as a person of religion .
what is mentioned above is the perspective of jodo shinshu , and the latter quotation exemplifies it .
it has long been known that this thought did not originate with shinran .
honen , the originator of jodoshu , referred to " yushin anrakudo ( way of securing relaxation and peace " ) , which was written in the seventh century by gangyo , a scholar of kagen-shu , in silla .
the third , kakunyo of jodoshinshu honganji , also remarked that the idea was originally preached by honen .
shinran 's idea is thought to amplify honen 's theory .
honen encouraged people to avoid evil and do good .
what emerged was people who undertook deeds to understand the meaning of ' evil persons ' claiming ' if you are to rescue evil persons then , evil action must be actively pursued . '
this is called ' honganbokori ( presumption upon the primal vow ) . '
shinran worried about it and warned against it , saying , ' you should not indulge yourself in poison , even if you have medicine . '
the jodo sanbu-kyo is a collective name for the basic three sutras of the various jodo sects in japan .
the name originated from what honen said in " senchaku hongan nenbutsu-shu " ( " senchaku-shu " ) ( the holy writings of the jodo sect ) .
in the various japanese jodo sects , it refers to the following three sutras , which were translated into chinese characters :

" bussetsu amida-kyo sutra "
" muryoju-kyo sutra " is one of the buddhist scriptures of mahayana buddhism .
the original title is " sukhavativyuha sutra ( ' sukhāvatīvyūha 'in sanskrit ) , " which means ' solemnity of the pure land ( gokuraku-no-sogon ) . '
it is also called " the larger sukhavativyuha sutra " in order to be distinguished from " amida sutra , " which has the same name in sanskrit
there is original text written in sanskrit as well as tibetan-translated text and chinese-translated text ( translated into chinese ) .
in japan , it is generally referred to as " bussetsu muryojukyo " ( translated by sogi kosogai ) .
the details can be found in the following bussetsu muryojukyo :
it is expressed in the present writing system due to the problems pertaining to a nation 's script ( daily-use kanji , kanji for common use and the list of 1006 kanji taught in japanese primary schools ) .
it is referred to as having a total of 12 translations , meaning the existing five and the seven that are missing .
out of the five existing translations , there are various theories about the translators of ' kan-yaku ( han translation ) , ' ' go-yaku ( go translation ) ' and ' gi-yaku ( wei translation ) . '

honen : " kanmuryoju kyo shaku " ( commentary of kanmuryoju kyo )
tarikihongan ( salvation by faith in amitabha ) has the following meanings :
the first meaning is the " hongan , " the original vow or pranidhana made by amida buddha , or amitabha .
this idea provides the foundation of jodo kyo ( pure land teachings ) with its belief in amida .
the second meaning is " relying on others " and " letting things take their course . "
these usages are converted from the original meaning mentioned above .
at present , the phrase " tariki hongan " is used for both types of the meanings mentioned above .
both groups of meanings are found in popular japanese-japanese dictionaries such as " daijirin " or " kojien , " and are used generally .
each meaning is described below in detail .
the second character 力 , which is pronounced as " riki , " of 他力本願 means 力用 " rikiyu " and indicates work .
in this sense tariki ( other power ) means the work done by others , but not by oneself .
however , when the word " tariki " is combined with " hongan , " the original vow , and makes the phrase " tariki hongan , " the meaning of " tariki " is completely different .
let us look into ken jodo shinjitsu kyogyosho monrui ( the true teaching , practice and realization of the pure land way ) written by shinran .
shinran wrote , " tariki means the power or work of the original vow made by amida . "
so the priests of the jodo kyo interpreted tariki as the work of the original vow made by amida buddha .
because of the power of hongan made by amida buddha himself , mankind is able to be born in the pure land .
that is why it is called " tariki ( other power ) hongan . "
" tariki " exactly means " the power of the original vow made by amida buddha . "
furthermore it is thought to mean that birth in the pure land would not be accomplished by one 's own work or acts .
in this sense the antonym of " tariki " ( other power ) is " jiriki " ( self power ) .
he also taught that people were alive because of the power of compassion or hongan , which came from the wisdom of amida buddha .
the second group of meanings of tariki hongan is mainly used in the context without a religious background , and indicates " relying on others " or " letting things take their course . "
below are the examples .
in may 2002 , olympus optical co . , ltd . ( present-day olympus corporation ) ran an advertisement using the phrase " let us get away from tariki hongan , " in a newspaper with nationwide circulation .
the federation of shinshu temples ( shinshu kyodan rengo ) made a protest against the corporation saying , " the expression in the ad hurts the feelings of many followers of the shinshu sect . "
after the protest , olympus apologized for its lack of consideration .
( from the asahi newspaper , may 28 , 2005 )
" amida-kyo sutra " ( sutra of amida buddha ) is one of sutras of mahayama buddhism .
its original title was " sukharvativyuha sutra " ( sukhāvatīvyūha in sanskrit ) , which means ' the solemnity of gokuraku ( the pure land ) . '
in order to distinguish it from " muryoju-kyo sutra " ( sutra of immeasurable life ) whose title is same in sanskrit , it 's also called " smaller sukharvativyuha sutra . "
its abbreviated title is " shokyo " ( smaller sutra ) while that of " muryoju-kyo sutra " is " daikyo " ( larger sutra ) .
it is estimated that this sutra was created in northern india in the first century .
the original version written in sanskrit still exists , as do the chinese and tibetan translations .
in japan , it usually refers to " bussetsu amida-kyo sutra " ( translated by kumaraju ) .
concerning the details , refer to the item of " bussetsu amida-kyo sutra " below .
the original sanskrit version was also introduced into japan in ancient times , and during the edo period it was published and became a subject of research .
" bussetsu amida-kyo sutra : " one volume , translated by kumaraju in the late quin era ( around 402 ) .
because it 's a very short sutra , its other name is " shishi-kyo " ( literally , the sutra of four papers ) .
" taisho shinshu daizo-kyo sutra " ( taisho tripitaka ) ( hereinafter referred to as " taishozo " ) : volume 12 , pp.346-348.
among the existent translations , this is the one that reflects the original most faithfully .
first , it preaches the solemnity of gokuraku jodo ( the land of perfect bliss ) , where amida-nyorai resides .
next , it exhorts to embrace the name of amida buddha in order to leave this world and be born in the pure land .
finally , it exhorts various buddha in roppo-sekai ( literally , the worlds of six directions ) to believe in this teaching with praise and sincerity .
" bussetsu sho muryoju-kyo " ( lesser sutra of the buddha of immeasurable life ) : one volume , translated by gunabadara of sung ( the southern court ) ( around 455 ) .

in this version , roppo-sekai , which appeared in kumaraju 's translation , was increased to jippo-sekai ( literally , the world of ten directions ) .
also , some descriptions reflecting the philosophy of ethnic discrimination are seen in this book .
tan-luan was a buddhist monk who lived during the period of the northern and southern dynasties in china .
he is thought to be the founder of jodo ( pure land ) sect in china .
he was born in yanmen ( present-day daixian , shanxi province , china ) close to mt . wutai shan .
it is not known when he was born or when he died , but it is thought that he lived from a year in the latter half of the northern wei period to the northern qi period .
he was the first patriarch of the five patriarchs of jodo sect , and the third of the seven patriarchs of jodo shin shu ( true pure land sect buddhism ) .
however , while he was annotating " mahsamnipata sutra , " he became sick .
he studied the secret art of eternal youth and longevity from tao hong-jing in maoshan and obtained ' sengyo ( taoist bible ) . '
on the way back home he met bodhiruci in luoyang .
bodhiruci persuaded him that it was buddhism that contained the true teachings of eternal life , and gave him " kan muryoju-kyo sutra " ( meditation sutra ) .
therefore , tan-luan burned ' sengyo ( taoist bible ) , ' and was converted to jodo sect .
by imperial order he was buried at text valley ( 文谷 ) of west qinling ( 西秦陵 ) in fenzhou .
( to be precise , " treatise on the pure land " itself was the commentary on " sutra of immeasurable life " ; tan-luan annotated the commentary again . )
he argued that in the days of mappo ( the end of the dharma ) without a buddha , one could attain nirvana only through birth in the pure land by believing in tariki ( other power ) .
at the end of the second volume , he proved that other power was the source of everything so logically and explicitly that one would feel as if one was watching the dominoes falling down one after another .
the priests who followed him such as tao-chuo and shan-dao as well as genshin , honen , and shinran in japan adopted tan-luan 's logic in their own theories because of its persuasiveness .
most of all , his theory forms the basis of shinran 's doctrine .
" san amida butsu ge " ( hymns in praise of amida buddha ) is a tribute to amida tathagata in poetic verse .
he declared that one should discard the difficult path and take the easy path where one entrusts everything to amida 's power described in the original vow .
thus he established the doctrine of jodo sect .
dao-chuo ( doshaku ) was a chinese monk chinese jodo ( pure land ) sect in the tang .
he was the second of the five founders of the jodo sect and the fourth founder of the seven eminent monks of the jodo shinshu ( the true pure land sect of buddhism ) .
he became a monk at 14 years of age and was well-versed in nehan-gyo sutra ( the sutra of the great nirvana ) .
later , he engaged in ascetic practices under the guidance of esan .
when , at age 48 , he saw donran 's inscription at genchu-ji temple and realized , then abandoned self-training , became a believer of the jodo sect and stayed at the temple .
he gave more than 200 lectures to monks and lay believers on " kanmuryoju-kyo sutra " ( ' the sutra of visualization of the buddha of measureless life , ' meaning amida ) .
it is said that he repeated nenbutsu ( buddhist invocation ) 70,000 times each day until his death .
he exhorted to speak out nenbutsu with juzu ( a roll of beads ) in ones hands .
( shomyo nenbutsu ) ( invocation of the name of buddha )
he died on may 27 , 645 at the age of 85 .
two volumes of " anrakushu " ( a collection of passages concerning birth in the pure land )
engi
engi in buddhism
it is described in the section below .
from these meanings , manners and customs such as ' enginaoshi ' ( to change one 's luck ) and ' engimono ' ( lucky charm ) can be seen .
it is also used to mean origin and history , and it shows the histories of shrines and temples , as well as the legends of merits appearing in those shrines and temples .
the word is an abbreviation for ' innenshoki ' ( fate and occurrence ) , ' in ' ( 因 ) meaning the cause and ' en ' ( 縁 ) meaning the condition .
according to buddhist scriptures , shaka mentioned engi as shown below .
the ｐrinciple of engi which i came to embrace is deeply mysterious and subtle at the same time , and as such , it is hard to grasp and realize its true meaning for an ordinary person .
engi is created neither by me nor any other person .
as a famous poem to express engi , it is preached in " jisetsu-kyo " ( sutra what shakyamuni preached by himself with nobody asking questions ) as shown below .
for there is " shi " ( this ) , there is " hi " ( that ) , and without " shi , " there cannot be " hi . "
when " shi " arises , " hi " also appears , and when " shi " perishes , " hi " also disappears .
this shows that the existence of " hi " ( that ) is regulated by " shi " ( this ) .
the two phrases of existence and nothingness put together is neither a rhetorical ornament nor a literary expression .
it is because if someone is not born , he can neither age nor die .
initially , engi was preached by shaka as the 12 innen ( destinies ) of a person 's life .
engi is sometimes interpreted as a preaching that corresponds to people 's wish to be taught , or ' kien sekki . '
for example , in kegon doctrine it 's called ' engi inbun . '
shandao clarified the interpretation ( interpretation of the six characters ) in six letters combining two letters of ' namu ( 南無 ) ' and four letters of ' amidabutsu ( 阿弥陀仏 ) . '
shinran set the myogo as the honzon ( principal image of buddha ) , and created six- , nine- and ten-letter myogo .
it is an interpretation shown by interpretation of the six characters of shandao , as mentioned above .
" gan " refers to the wishes of those among mankind who believe ' namu ' and amida buddha .
" gyo " refers to the ascetic practices of amida buddha for the salvation of mankind .
" ki " refers to the faith of mankind ( namu ) .
" ho " refers to honganriki ( power of the original vow ) of amida buddha , who saves the mankind ( amidabutsu ) .
it is an interpretation that ki of mankind and ho of amida buddha have inseparably united and become ' namu amidabutsu . '
shomyo means the invocation of the name ( s ) of the buddha and / or bodhisattva .
shomyo especially means reciting namu amida butsu , which is the myogo ( name ) of amida buddha and signifies homage to amida buddha .
sometimes shomyo indicates that shobutsu ( many buddhas ) chant the name of amida buddha with admiration and praise ( shobutsu shomyo is in the seventeenth of the forty-eight vows made by amida buddha ) .
in jodo ( pure land ) sect , shomyo particularly means invoking the name of amida buddha ( namu amida butsu ) .
this name invoking is a shojo no go ( a rightly established practice ) in order to be reborn in the pure land .
because shomyo was the act that amida vowed in the hongan ( the original vow ) , it was a shojo no go ( a rightly established practice ) , he argued .
chanting for salvation was not about reflecting on achievements but , was seen to relate solely on the power of buddha 's name when used in prayer .
thus , it certainly is the shojo no goin ( the rightly established cause ) .
shinran explained , ' faith is the proper cause of the birth in the pure land , and one invokes amida 's name in order to repay the benevolence of amida buddha . '
( it is called shinjin shoin [ faith is the proper cause . ] , shomyo hon [ invocation is to repay the benevolence . ] )
other than buddhism , one can find many descriptions about the belief that one can escape suffering and receive relief by invoking the names of gods and buddhas in the sacred books of taoism .
( one can find something similar also in the muslim world . )
jodo ( pure land ) is a buddhist concept which pointed to a world clean and pure .
it is also called " josetsu " , " jokoku " or " jokai . "
this word is heteronymous to edo ( impure land in buddhism . )
the edo , as opposed to jodo , is also called ekoku ( defiled land ) , a land filled with eaku ( impurities ) .
it describes lands , such as desert and undeveloped wastelands , as ekoku .
in this place , the human beings have tied themselves up , looking at delusions without knowing they are delusional .
they are obsessed with , and suffered from , these delusions , and this is the world of bonno ( earthly desires ) .
as opposed to edo , where people can not feel any material and spiritual well being , jodo ( pure land ) is a pure clean land .
this sort of pure land is the legitimate land of buddha .
hence , jodo is the buddha-land .
as seen from this , the pureness of the world depends on spirituality .
thus , the purity or impurity of the land is dictated by the spirit of the residents who live there .
hence , the legitimate jodo is the place buddha resides , and the land of bosatsu ( bodhisattva ) who is devoted to becoming a buddha .
from this point of view , jodo is the land of buddha .
however , although jodo is the land of buddha , the land of buddha is not necessarily jodo .
the world for buddha 's edificatory purpose is also the land of buddha , hence , the world of bonpu ( ordinary unenlightened person ) could be the land of buddha .
this means the lands of buddha indicate the adobe of buddha and all edificatory worlds .
hence , the jodo is the world of bosatsu attaining to become a buddha .
there are various traditions devoted to various jodo .
amongst them , the amida buddha 's " seiho gokuraku jodo ( the west pure land ) " is a famous one .
in that sense , the word ' jodo ' ( pure land ) is a common noun rather than a proper noun .
the world of the impure hinders the ascetic in training from becoming a buddha .
that is why each buddha leads one to jodo and provides these buddhist benefits in order to make it easier to do ascetic training .
in this sense , the jodo is a place for buddha 's satisfaction , and for the benefit of others - the satisfaction for both parties .
these jodo are not in this world that we live in , but built in another world .
people only go there when their life ends in this world , hence , the concept of ojo jodo ( birth in the pure land ) exists .
significantly , the amida-buddha 's seiho gokuraku jodo forms the jodo sect which takes the position of the ojo jodo .
there is another school of thought that , rather than teaching about the building of jodo in another world , teaches that the world will shift to jodo as is .
for example , " hokkekyo ( lotus sutra ) " preaches to alter this corrupt world to the land of lapis lazuli of the jodo world ( shabasoku jakko ) .
this concept was taken by the ryozen jodo of shaka ( shkyamuni ) and the lotus matrix world of birushana-butsu ( vairocana ) .
in a certain sense , these places conform to jodo .
to go to that jodo , and attain enlightenment through being led by buddha , is the belief of jodo .
the word as geographical names in japan .
a geographical name of meito ward , nagoya city , aichi prefecture .
a former geographical name of suita city , osaka prefecture .
the name of a koaza ( small administrative unit ) in oaza takaze , mizobe-cho , kirishima city , kagoshima prefecture .
the name of a station on the akechi railway is gokuraku station .
a pair of comedians of yoshimoto kogyo co . , ltd . , who have broken up is gokuraku tonbo .
a figurative expression meaning that a person is in a joyful or happy state .
the word is sometimes used as an exclamation by a person soaking in the bathtub .
one of the buddhist terms in the list .
it is described in this section .
gokuraku ' and ' sukhaavatii ' are sanskrit words used to refer to the jodo ( pure land ) that amida nyorai established .
in " amida-kyo sutra , " it is said that ' the place is called gokuraku , since there is no shuku but only shoraku ( all kinds of enjoyment ) . '
shinran commented about ' gokuraku mui nehankai ' in " yuishinsho-moni " ( notes on faith alone ) as shown below .
gokuraku ' is that peaceful pure land , where joy is always around and pain does not come near .
that place is called anyo , and donran kasho said that ' with praise , i call the place anyo . '
in ' nehankai , ' perplexity without light is changed to satori ( enlightenment ) with mujonehan ( absolute nirvana ) .
kai ' is a border , or the border of enlightenment .
in other words , gokuraku , relatively speaking , is a peaceful place for feeling and the body , as opposed to pain in the real world .
in the absolute sense , gokuraku is a world without pain or joy , which is called mui nehan kai ( world of enlightenment of absolutely permanent existence ) .
gokuraku can be called a world ' filled with happiness . '
therefore , people have referred to this place in various ways since the old times .
listed below are some other common names for gokuraku .
jodo ( pure land )
gokuraku tanharakoku ( 極楽湛蕨国 )
anyo
mui
anraku
muryo komyodo
shochiso
shojosho
gonjokoku
rengezo sekai
daijo zenkonkai
ichijo shojo muryoju sekai
nehanjo
shinnyomon
hodo
gokuraku is explained in detail in ' jodo sanbu-kyo ' ( the three main sutras of the pure land sect ) .
because the atmosphere of gokuraku is described with particular detail in " bussetsu amida-kyo " ( the sutra of amida buddha ) , the summary of it is described below based on this sutra .
the time goes up before ten kalpa , and amida nyorai completed the path to becoming a buddha by attaining enlightenment and established jodo at a place over a billion buddha-lands in the west .
and even now , he preaches for people in this gokuraku .
further , they are very pure and shine very brightly .
consequently , in this jodo there is no pain , but only joy exists .
in this world , all the people have muryoju ( immeasurable life ) and muryoko ( immeasurable light ) , like buddha , and there is no limit to their wisdom and mercy .
in summary , people in the jodo sect see gokuraku as hodo ; moreover , common people can also enter this hodo .
also in the tendai sect , jodo of amitabha is regarded as a land where common people and saints both exist , and it 's a land of retsuojin ( buddha of an inferior manifested body ) .
people in the jodo sect basically see gokuraku as hodo in anrakushu ( a collection of passages concerning birth in the pure land ) , by doshaku .
jodo is hodo .
the reason for it in the jodo sect is that since common people believe in the oath of buddha they are allowed to make ojo .
about this jodo , it has been preached since ancient times that ' yuishin no mida , koshin no jodo ' and ' koshin no mida , yuishin no jodo . '
this thought is mainly believed in the kegon and zen sects .
their basis is the phrase contained in " kegon-kyo sutra : " ' heart , buddha and people , all three of them have no difference . '
however , people in jodo-mon ( gateway of the pure land ) make jodo of jiso ( phenomenon ) and hold the position that they see buddha outside their hearts .
of course , even though people of jodo-mon say that gokuraku is jodo of jiso , they say it still matches the buddhist thought of muso ( without any shape ) .
the position of jodo-mon like this shows religious thoughts that are different from shodo-mon .
the 48 vows refers to the 48 vows made by hozo bosatsu ( dharmakara ) prior to the start of ascetic training to attain buddhahood .
there are variances in the translation of the " muryo-kyo sutra , " or the original sanskrit text of " bussetsu muryoju-kyo sutra , " so that there are discrepancies in the number of vows .
muryo-kyo sutra is roughly divided into the 24-vow group and the 48-vow group .
of the above two groups , the former is considered to represent the philosophy of the early pure land sect , whereas the latter is supposed to represent that of the late developed stage of the pure land sect .
various japanese lines of the pure land buddhism sect , such as the jodo sect and the jodo shinshu ( the true pure land sect of buddhism ) , consider the ' 18th vow ' to be particularly important .

vow 48
title : tokusanponin no gan
eon and kyogo
the 48 vows have been broken down into three categories by eon and kyogo , of china .
the name and grouping of each category is as follows :
shoboshingan and kyubutsushingan ( 求仏身願 ) : for buddha to perfect the body of buddha , vows 12 , 13 and 17
setsujodogan ( 摂浄土願 ) ・ kyubutsudogan ( 求仏土願 ) : completion of the buddha land , which allows sentient beings to be reborn in : vows 31 and 32
shinran
shinran , of japan , broke down the 48 vows into reality and apotheosis .
these vows were developed to resolve the problems of all the sorrows and suffering of sentient beings that had been observed .
this refers to the concept that satisfaction is derived from the expectedhope for effects in other directions as a result of an individual 's good deeds .
though the karma of good deeds is essentially supposed to come back to oneself , everything is regarded as being empty in mahayana buddhism , so it is possible to turn the karma to others .
that is to say , turning and giving charity and merit that one pursues to others , is called eko .
this is why the envelope says " eko ryo ( fee for a memorial service ) " when hiring a temple or a priest for sutra chanting .
the levels of ascetic practices with the mind of eko are divided into ten , which are called " juekoi ( ten eko levels ) " and are regarded as important processes of ascetic practices for enlightenment .
the charity one pursues is turned to buddhahood to remove self-obsession .
" charity " is always turned in the directions of others , and turns into " merit , " then self-centeredness is removed .
this is the inevitability of eko .
it is not to mean that the accumulation of charity becomes buddha , but that all charity has meaning in having eko .
eko generally consists of three kinds ; ( 1 ) bodai eko ( awakening eko ) , ( 2 ) syujo eko ( mankind eko ) , ( 3 ) jissai eko ( reality eko ) .
they are supposed to lead to awakening , to give merit to mankind , and to pursue the enlightenment of absolutely permanent existence , respectively .
this altruistic attainment is also done by eko with amida buddha 's honganriki ( power of original vow ) .
therefore , both oso and genso have eko , transmitting merit from the buddha to mankind by amida buddha 's honganriki .
this is called " tariki eko ( eko with other-power ) . "
specifically , during the edo period in sanuki province , a pious jodo shinshu sect believer named shoma said ; ' there are those that are happy to make use of the buddha i have discarded . '
" ekobun , " which is also called " ekoge , " refers to gemon ( metrical style of teachings ) chanted at the end of a devotion or a memorial service .
it is recited to provide eko for widely involved people , not only to give the merit of a buddhist rite to those who hold it .
in this sense , a buddhist rite held in a temple or each household has eko not only for the deceased , but for all the people involved .
gebun varies among religious doctrines .
- " the lotus sutra , " the third volume ' kejoyuhon number seven ' translated by kumaraju ( " taisho shinshu daizo-kyo sutra " the ninth volume p24 . )
- " kammuryojukyosho , " ' kangyogengibun the first volume ' written by shandao ( " taisho shinshu daizo-kyo sutra " the thirty-seventh volume p246 . )
since the schools of the jodo ( pure land ) sect have the jodo sanbu-kyo ( the three main sutras of the pure land sect ) as the main scripture , the latter is used .
and the jodo shinshu sect take " this merit " as the merit of amida buddha .
ojo is a methodology for becoming a buddha , as defined by the mahayana buddhism .
there are various interpretations of pure lands for rebirth , but it generally means the buddhist paradise that is considered to be the pure land of amida buddha .
kesho is one of the four categories of birth for creatures ; the others are taisho ransho , shissho and kesho .
taisho : to come out of the mother 's body , as with humans and animals .
ransho : to be hatched from eggs , as with birds
shissho : to come out of a moist environment , as with insects
kesho : to come into existence in a converted form as a consequence of one 's past actions
such as celestial beings
it is said that to be born in the pure land of amitabha means to be reincarnated as the result of the karma that is generated in that land .
renge kesho means to be reincarnated surrounded by lotus ( renge ) flowers in the pure land of amitabha .
original meaning
the original meaning of ojo is to go to the country of buddha ( india ) , be born in that land to become a buddha , and to attain enlightenment .
thus the primary meaning of ojo is to become a buddha but not simply to go to the pure land of amitabha .
inevitability
in buddhism , to attain enlightenment is to attain the state of perfect self-effacement .
for one to understand that he is empty and nothing , the state of ' ego ' should not exist while one is in training .
assuming that it is impossible to attain buddhahood as long as there is ego-consciousness , it will be impossible to remove the ego-consciousness by oneself .
it is the standpoint of jodo-mon ( gateway of the pure land ) that this is the reason one needs to meet and see buddha to attain buddhahood .
the general meaning of ' ojo '
additionally , the world one goes to when he or she dies is the world of buddha , so to be born in that world is to become a buddha .
given the foregoing , it is considered that ojo means to become a buddha .
in reality , because ojo means to die and , moreover , to become a buddha , it is considered that the line of thought where one would become a buddha upon death became common .
death due to a natural cause , such as succumbing to old age and particularly multiple organ failure due to old age , is often referred to as a peaceful death .
it is considered that this definition of ' ojo ' became further secularized , so that it meant ' to be cornered and not know what to do . '
zenjo ( dhyaana in sanskrit , jhaana in pali ) is to meditate and observe the truth while focusing one 's mind .
it also means the stability attained through zenjo under which neither one 's mind nor body is unsettled by anything .
it is the compound term of ' zen , ' a transcription of sanskrit dhyaana , and its free translation ' jo , ' which has the same meaning as zanmai .
originally , it was daigo zenna haramitsu ( paramita ) , one of six haramitsu that bosatsu ( bodhisattva ) of mahayana buddhism was obliged to practice .
zenna ( dhyāna ) is translated as ' zenjo ' and means stabilizing the unsettled mind by thinking the truth .
in the process of attaining such a state , according to agama sutra , there are four stages ranging from shozen ( the first dhyana ) to daishizen ( the fourth dhyana ) .
these are collectively called ' shijoryo ' ( also referred as shizen ) .
these are collectively called ' shimushikijo ' ( four concentrations of the formless realm ) and are followed by kushidaijo ( nine successive stages of concentration ) and hyakuhachi zanmai ( one hundred eight kinds of samadhi ) .
( regarding the relationship between zenjo and wisdom , refer to shikan ( tendai meditation ) ) .
the zen sect , which abolished zenjo practices and pursued tongo ( prompt enlightenment ) , was established in china .
although this sect brought forth a new definition of zenjo ( i.e. , zazen ) and had the aspect of completely denying the existing buddhism , it prospered in the era of the tang dynasty .
the zen sect was introduced into japan by eisai and dogen during the period of the southern sung dynasty .
in japan , zenjo practices were revived again and became popular as the principal tokumoku ( virtue ) of samurai ( warriors ) .
samādhi is also transcribed in chinese characters as 三摩提 or 三摩地 .
in the process of attaining sanmai , according to agama sutra , there are four stages from shozen ( the first dhyana ) to daishizen ( the fourth dhyana ) .
the former four stages are collectively called ' shijoryo ' ( shizen ) , and the latter four stages are collectively called ' shimushikijo ' ( four concentrations of the formless realm ) .
the above process is related to the hierarchical structure of sangai ( three realms ) : yokkai , the realm of desire ; shikikai , the realm of form ; and mushikikai , the realm of non-form .
yokkai ( consciousness based on desire ) becomes ' sanchi ' through the above process .
similarly , shikikai split into four classes , shozenten ( first dhyana heaven ) , dainizenten ( second dhyana heaven ) , daisanzenten ( third dhyana heaven ) and daishizenten ( fourth dhyana heaven ) .
these comprise sangaikuji ( three realms and nine levels ) .
according to buddhist literature , shakyamuni arrived at the stage of musho-usho and hisohihisosho soon after he entered the buddhist priesthood .
however , because he was unsatisfied with the above stage he practiced kugyo ( asceticism ) , and then , after abandoning kugyo , he pursued a new way of practice .
the initial mahayana buddhism emphasized sanmai and the importance of ' hyakuhachi zanmai ' ( one hundred eight kinds of samadhi ) etc . , were preached in the prajnaparamita-sutra .
tendai chigi in the sui dynasty period , asserted that stopping mental function through sanmai alone was meaningless for buddhism .
shishuzanmai ( the four kinds of sanmai ) based on makashikan ( the mahayana practice of shikan ) are categorized into four , as shown below .
joza zanmai ( ichigyo zanmai ) ( a meditation of tendai sect to sit in meditation for a period of ninety days without engaging in any other practices )
continue to sit for 90 days .
jogyo zanmai ( butsuryu zanmai ) ( constantly walking samadhi in tendai sect )
repeat the name of buddha for 90 days while going round amitabha .
hangyo hanza zanmai ( both seated and ambulatory meditation )
conduct the practice of going around the principal image , alternated with that of sitting .
hodo zanmai ( vaipulya meditation )
to be practiced for seven days based on the " daihodo-darani-kyo " ( sutra dharani ) .
hokke sanmai ( dharma-lotus samadhi )
to be practiced either for 37 days or 21 days based on " the hokekyo sutra " ( lotus sutra ) .
higyo hiza zanmai ( zuijii zanmai ) ( meditation on reality in an unspecified posture for an unspecified period of times )
the following terms are the free translations of samādhi .
jo
it means fixing the mind at one point and making it immovable .
shoju
it means receiving the teachings ( buddhism ) correctly .
jojikijo
it means calming the mind , correcting the devious mind and fixing the distracted mind .
shoshingyosho
it means fitting the movement of the mind to buddhism .
sokuryogyoshin
it means stopping to think and collect the mind .
( reading-zanmai ; study-zanmai ; and extravagance-zanmai , etc . in these cases , sanmai is pronounced ' -zanmai , ' a voiced syllable of sanmai ) .
a crematory is sometimes called ' sanmai . '
" onriedo ( also called enriedo ) , " a term associated with the jodo ( pure land ) sect , is often used to express an antithesis with gongujodo ( seeking rebirth in the pure ) .
" onriedo-gongujodo " was used by ieyasu tokugawa for his uma-jirushi ( commanders ' flag ) during the sengoku period ( the warring states period ) .
wasan means an anthem sung in japanese to praise buddha , bosatsu , soshi ( founder of a sect ) , ancient virtue , buddhist scriptures , creed , etc .
this is a counterpart to bonsan ( sanskrit hymns ) chanted in sanskrit , or kansan chanted in ancient chinese .
many of the wasan were made in poems of the seven-five syllable style , and were chanted with the intonation that was popular in the period when the wasan was made .
the oldest wasan was made in the heian period , and there were popular wasan called ' hokke santan ' and ' momosaka sandan . '
most of of them became popular with the tendai jodo sect in the middle of the heian period .
in the kamakura period , wasan was widely recognized with the propagation of buddhism , and became popular in various sects of kamakura bukkyo ( new buddhist movements of the kamakura period ) .
kueissho is one of the benefits in the jodo sect , regarding one 's passing into the pure land .
the term means that those who pass into amida buddha 's pure land can meet buddha and many bosatsus in the same place .
genso-eko ( virtue as instructed by amida for retiring from the pure land to this world ) is one of the important jodo sect doctrines ( teachings of the pure land ) .
it is one of the two aspects of eko ( amida tathagata 's directing of virtue ) .
he continues to explain the two types of eko as follows .
whether one is going forth or returning , it is all entirely for the sake of leading sentient beings across the sea of birth-and-death .
therefore , ' it is to fulfill a compassionate mind by accepting virtue as first priority . '
broad meaning :
interpreted as that , one is inclined to conceptualize something like a spirit which has returned from the pure land to this world .
in fact some scholars do interpret it that way .
this is the primary a concept of genso-eko in the teachings of jodo sect .
also shinran explains in " a collection of passages revealing the true teaching , the practice and realization of the pure land way " as follows :
benefiting from returning is an example of one 's true intention of benefiting others .
in this regard , vasubandhu , the author , says the single broad unfettered mind awakens universally .
reverently embrace these words ; receive them in deepest homage .
as above , genso-eko should be interpreted as ritagyo ( altruistic practices ) .
shinran further explains in " passages on the pure land way " as follows :
second , genso-eko is benefit of ritakyoke-chi ( competency to enlighten others to head for the true pure land ) .
it came out from the 22th vow of the 48 vows .
also i named it as issho fusho no gan ( vow of succession to buddhahood after one lifetime ) or genso-eko no gan ( vow of genso-eko ) .
as above , he points the 22 vow from the 48 vows of amida as the basis for his explanation .
in conclusion , he explains that everything is fulfilled by the power of amida 's primal vow .
by devoting our thinking about the true purpose of the way to the pure land , we can see that amida 's instructions of virtue to sentient beings have two aspects :
to go forward to the pure land and the return to this world .
to go forward , there is the teaching , practice , faith , and enlightenment of the truth .
( from " a collection of passages that reveal the true lessons , practice and understanding of the way to the pure land " )
each of above is explained by shinran as follows .
teaching
to unveil the true lessons : one must study the larger sutra of the buddha on immeasurable life .
shakyamuni came into this world and preached the way to enlightenment , to save the multitudes of living creatures by blessing them with benefits that are truthful and genuine .
so , to preach tathagata 's primal vow is the true intention of this sutra ; the essence is in the name of the buddha .
practice
devotedly thinking about amida 's instructions on virtue for the journey to the pure land , there is great practice , great faith .
great practice in reciting the name of tathagata of prevailing light .
embodying all good acts , possessing all the roots of virtue , is the most perfect and quickest way to bring about birth .
it is a treasure house of virtues that is the true reality .
and because of this , it is called great practice .
this practice comes from the vow of great compassion ( 17th vow ) .
faith
unending devotion to thinking about amida 's instructions of virtue for our journey forward , there is great faith .
through the nenbutsu ( buddhist invocation ) the mind arises from the vow of birth .
this great selected primal vow of the threefold mind , the vow of sincerity and trustfulness , and may also be called the vow of faith , which is amida 's instructions on virtue for our journey forward .
the reason is because this realization comes about through tathagata 's powerful support ; completely through the power of compassion and wisdom .
if pure shinjin is to be realized , it is a mindset that will not be innovated ; it will not be false or in vain .
a sentient being of extreme evil , profound , and gigantic , will realize great joy and receive love and veneration of all the honored sacred ones .
enlightenment
to unveil , with steadfast devotion , the true understanding : it is a wonderful state achieved through amida 's pure benefiting of others ; it is the ultimate flowering of supreme nirvana .
it blooms from the vow of the achievement required of nirvana ( the 11th vow ) .
also it is known as the vow achieving great nirvana .
because they live among the truly settled , they attain nirvana .
to attain nirvana is to achieve eternal bliss .
eternal bliss is the ultimate tranquility .
tranquility is supreme nirvana .
supreme nirvana is the eternal dharma-body .
the eternal dharma-body is true reality .
true reality is the nature of dharma .
the nature of dharma is suchness .
suchness is oneness .
amida tathagata emerges from suchness and is manifested in various bodies ; transformed , accommodated , and fulfilled .
as can be seen from the above , how foolish beings attain birth in the pure land is explained through teaching , practice , faith , and enlightenment .
this does not mean practice when foolish beings direct their merit toward attaining birth , but is the practice fulfilled when amida instructs out of great compassion .
faith is not the belief that foolish beings have in amida , but is what is instructed to them by the power of the primal vow .
similarly , it is explained that enlightenment is what is attained by amida and is directed to living beings .
monto is a name one uses for comrades of the same sect .
particularly , it indicates the people who belong to the same school and share the same belief .
it has also come to indicate the danto ( supporters ) belonging to a temple .
especially in jodo shinshu , it is general to call danto and believers ' monto , ' but it 's rare that one would refer to the danto of other buddhist sects by that name .
consequently , ' jodo shinshu ' is sometimes called montoshu .
occasionally , the word is used with the names of regions , like calling the monto of xx region as ' xx monto . '
( examples : mikawa no kuni monto ( monto of mikawa province ) , aki no kuni monto ( monto of aki province , and so on ) ) .
in the wasan ( japanese hymn ) by shinran ( " koso wasan " ) : ' always show monto . '
in " hoonkoshiki , " by kakunyo : ' always talk to monto . '

a count .
his imina ( personal name ) was kozui and his homyo ( a name given to a person who enters the buddhist priesthood ) ( jodo shinshu - the true pure land sect of buddhism ) was kyonyo .

later , he entered an english school called kyoritsu-gakusha ( that was different from kyoritsu-gakko which was known for its curriculum preparing for entrance exams ) which shinpachi seki opened , but still dropped out .
he returned to kyoto and studied under the supervision of eun maeda ( later the president of toyo university and ryukoku university ) .
in august 1902 as a part of the activities of the religious organization , he went to india to explore central asia and excavate buddhist remains .
in january 1903 , his father koson died and thus he came back to japan to succeed the chief priest , but he continued exploration and research activities until 1904 .
this is so-called the otani expedition ( the first ) .

he made it a center for cultural activities .
in 1914 he resigned the chief priest and retired in dalian city , in order to sort out the huge amount of debt the otani family had and the bribery scandal of his religious organization .
he then relinquished nirakuso and the exploration collections .
today , these collections have been scattered and nirakuso was also burnt down by fire in 1932 .
during the pacific war , he served as a councilor in the fumimaro konoe cabinet , and the adviser in the collaborative cabinet of kuniaki koiso and mitsumasa yonai .
however in 1945 , he came down with bladder cancer and detained by the soviet army during his hospitalization .
